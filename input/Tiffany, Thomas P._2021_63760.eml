Dear Friend,

Before we get started, we just wanted to thank all of you who are sharing t=
he Telegram with your friends and neighbors and we hope you=E2=80=99ll keep doing =
so. And remember you can always direct folks interested in learning more abo=
ut what=E2=80=99s happening in Wisconsin and Washington to our website, where they=
 can subscribe to our weekly update and see what we=E2=80=99re working on.

This week I was appointed to serve on two committees during the 117th Congr=
ess. I retained my seat on the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdic=
tion over key policy issues related to constitutional questions, crime, terr=
orism, immigration, anti-trust law, the federal judiciary and civil rights. =
 I also secured a seat on the House Committee on Natural Resources, which ov=
ersees federal land agencies like the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Managem=
ent and National Park Service, tackles key issues like forest and wildlife m=
anagement, mining and energy development on public lands, water and power an=
d policies related to Indian Tribes, U.S. territories and insular areas such=
 as Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Closer to home you may have seen that the State Senate gave preliminary app=
roval to legislation that would rein in Governor Evers=E2=80=99 prolonged emergenc=
y order mandating the use of face masks. While I am not a member of the stat=
e legislature and did not vote on this legislation, I have been receiving ca=
lls from many of you asking for more information about this effort and wante=
d to keep you updated.  The bill legislators passed does not prohibit or res=
trict mask use. It represents a check and balance to the governor=E2=80=99s attemp=
t to impose open-ended, sweeping =E2=80=9Cemergency=E2=80=9D orders without coming to th=
e state legislature for approval. Whether one supports a mask requirement or=
 not, we can all agree that the executive branch should not have the authori=
ty to simply rule by decree.

This week we also observed Holocaust Remembrance Day =E2=80=93 the anniversary da=
te of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. It is a sober tim=
e for all of us to honor the victims of the Holocaust and renew our efforts =
to prevent such horrors from being repeated in the future. Sadly, we continu=
e to see people around the world targeted for systematic persecution, violen=
ce, sterilization and even death for their race, ethnicity, and religion. As=
 Telegram readers know, bipartisan majorities in Congress have taken aim at =
the government of Communist China for its actions against ethnic Uyghurs, wh=
o have been forced into concentration camps and subjected to shocking human =
rights abuses.  The U.S. State Department recently determined that China=E2=80=99s=
 actions constitute genocide, and policymakers must work together to ensure =
that =E2=80=9CNever Again=E2=80=9D is not just a slogan.=20
In this week=E2=80=99s edition of the Telegram we want to tell you about:
Preventing court packing and defending the integrity of the Supreme Court
Spending bonanza reveals fraud, mismanagement
The human cost of school closures
WHO finally updates guidance on COVID tests amid =E2=80=9Cfalse positives=E2=80=9D
District COVID update
Vaccine update
Preventing =E2=80=9Ccourt packing=E2=80=9D and defending the integrity of the Supreme C=
ourt=20
This week I joined my colleagues in backing an amendment to the constitutio=
n that would fix the number of Supreme Court justices at nine. This would he=
ad off partisan efforts to expand the nation=E2=80=99s highest court and dilute th=
e independence of the judicial branch. I believe that it is important to pro=
tect constitutional separation of powers, something a =E2=80=9Ccourt packing=E2=80=9D sc=
heme would undermine. Despite numerous highly polarized attempts to change t=
he size of the Supreme Court throughout our history, it has remained at nine=
 justices for over 150 years. Now, more than ever, it is critical we preserv=
e the credibility of the judicial branch and maintain the long-standing stru=
cture of our highest court. You can take a look at the proposed constitution=
al amendment here.=20

Spending bonanza reveals fraud, mismanagement=20
California officials recently confirmed that a whopping $11.4 billion in un=
employment benefits paid out during the COVID-19 pandemic have been, or are =
currently being, investigated as fraud. While this is disappointing, it is n=
ot surprising. When politicians rubber-stamp such huge public expenditures w=
ith little debate and even less oversight, widespread waste, fraud and abuse=
 tend to be the result. Sadly, California is hardly alone when it comes to p=
oor administration of jobless benefits. As Telegram readers know, Wisconsin =
has also struggled to make sure that payments are being received by those wh=
o need them in a timely fashion, according to the state=E2=80=99s Legislative Fisc=
al Bureau. You can read more about the situation in Wisconsin here.  This is=
 a cautionary tale for taxpayers as Congress prepares to consider another bu=
dget-busting $1.9 trillion spending bill =E2=80=93 even as the ink has barely drie=
d on the blowout $2.3 trillion package Congress just approved. We must take =
care to ensure that we that we are not throwing good money after bad and add=
ing trillions in new debt first and asking important questions later.

The human cost of school closures=20
As the majority of our K-12 schools throughout the 7th Congressional Distri=
ct are currently operating on a full in-person or hybrid teaching model I wo=
uld like to draw your attention to a different part of the country this week=
. The New York Times published a story on Sunday highlighting the heartbreak=
ing impact that overreaching quarantine models and mandatory distance learni=
ng have had on children=E2=80=99s mental health. Clark County school district in N=
evada uses an early-warning system that monitors students=E2=80=99 mental health e=
pisodes when they are in a virtual learning setting. Since March, district o=
fficials have received more than 3,100 alerts ranging from suicidal thoughts=
, possible self-harm, or need for care in homes with negligent parental figu=
res. Since the implementation of that system, 18 students have taken their o=
wn lives. These months of all-virtual learning will have mental health impli=
cations for children for years to come, something I have often warned about,=
 and while parents and community leaders in our district have worked hard to=
 keep our kids in school, there are millions of children across the country =
who have not been so lucky. We cannot continue to exacerbate these issues by=
 isolating students at home and failing to provide in-person resources for b=
ehavioral health needs.

WHO updates guidance on COVID tests amid =E2=80=9Cfalse positives=E2=80=9D=20
On January 20, the World Health Organization issued an advisory for labs pr=
ocessing PCR tests to carefully follow the instructions for processing in or=
der to determine the presence of the virus causing a positive COVID-19 test =
result. The WHO guidance for diagnostic testing now clearly states that a we=
ak positive test result should be revisited in the lab and possibly requires=
 retesting using an antigen or lateral flow test. This guidance comes as the=
 result of PCR tests being called into question based on an exceedingly high=
 number of false positives. It was often determined to be an error on the pa=
rt of lab practitioners who were incorrectly adjusting the PCR positivity th=
reshold. The WHO is now admitting that a positive test result on a PCR test =
may not mean a guaranteed case of COVID-19. Far more critical than the test =
result is the actual presence of symptoms, a fact I have emphasized for mont=
hs in the battle to keep schools open for in-person learning. Some have used=
 fear mongering tactics that not only penalize people who may never even hav=
e COVID-19, but also politicize results through over-testing =E2=80=93 which deple=
tes supplies in communities with lower accessibility.=20
District COVID update=20
In the past week the number of positive cases each day has continued to dro=
p significantly with the statewide 7-day average nearing fewer than 1,700 ne=
w cases each day. While the positive cases are still higher than we would li=
ke to see at this stage in the pandemic these numbers mark major improvement=
 from November and December when we measured upwards of 5,000 new cases each=
 day. In the 7th district, our hospital capacity remains stable in both the =
North Central and Northwest regions with bed capacity holding steady at 80 p=
ercent and 70 percent of total capacity respectively.    =20

Vaccine update=20
This week several major announcements came out of the Governor=E2=80=99s office a=
nd the Department of Health Services (DHS). As of Monday, Wisconsin resident=
s over the age of 65 are now eligible to receive the vaccine. DHS is directi=
ng those individuals to check with your healthcare provider as the first ste=
p for trying to schedule a vaccination appointment. If your healthcare provi=
der is not doing vaccinations, you can then utilize DHS or your local health=
 department to coordinate other options. In addition to residents over 65, f=
rontline healthcare workers, fire and police personnel, and correctional sta=
ff are all eligible. If you fall into one of those categories and have not y=
et received the vaccine, please check with your employer or use DHS as a sec=
ondary option. Additionally, Governor Evers announced earlier this week that=
 the next phase of eligible residents will include education and childcare w=
orkers, individuals enrolled in Medicaid, non-frontline healthcare personnel=
, public-facing essential workers i.e. grocery employees, and staff and resi=
dents in congregate living. The estimated date for that group to begin recei=
ving their first dose is March 1 based on the supplies currently available, =
however the date may change as we get closer to FDA approval for other brand=
s. If you have any questions regarding your vaccine status please utilize th=
e DHS website.

In case you missed it=E2=80=A6=20
We wanted to congratulate Caleb Peterson of Barron for his acceptance to th=
e United States Military Academy at West Point. Every year students across t=
he country apply to serve their country and receive a top-notch education at=
 one of five U.S. Service Academies:  The U.S. Military Academy in West Poin=
t, New York, the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, the U.S. Air For=
ce Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy i=
n Kings Point, New York, and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Con=
necticut. Each of the Service Academies except the U.S. Coast Guard Academy =
require a nomination from the student=E2=80=99s Congressman, Senator or the Vice P=
resident. Should you or someone you know be interested in attending one of o=
ur fine academies, you can find more information here.

District COVID update </strong><br>In the past week the number of positive c=
ases each day has continued to drop significantly with the statewide 7-day a=
verage nearing fewer than 1,700 new cases each day. While the positive cases=
 are still higher than we would like to see at this stage in the pandemic th=
ese numbers mark major improvement from November and December when we measur=
ed upwards of 5,000 new cases each day. In the 7th district, our hospital ca=
pacity remains stable in both the North Central and Northwest regions with b=
ed capacity holding steady at 80 percent and 70 percent of total capacity re=
spectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong><a id=3D"vaccine" style=3D"c=

br>This week several major announcements came out of the Governor=E2=80=99s office=
 and the Department of Health Services (DHS). As of Monday, Wisconsin reside=
nts over the age of 65 are now eligible to receive the vaccine. DHS is direc=
ting those individuals to check with your healthcare provider as the first s=
tep for trying to schedule a vaccination appointment. If your healthcare pro=
vider is not doing vaccinations, you can then utilize DHS or your local heal=
th department to coordinate other options. In addition to residents over 65,=
 frontline healthcare workers, fire and police personnel, and correctional s=
taff are all eligible. If you fall into one of those categories and have not=
 yet received the vaccine, please check with your employer or use DHS as a s=
econdary option. Additionally, Governor Evers announced earlier this week th=
at the next phase of eligible residents will include education and childcare=
 workers, individuals enrolled in Medicaid, non-frontline healthcare personn=
el, public-facing essential workers i.e. grocery employees, and staff and re=
sidents in congregate living. The estimated date for that group to begin rec=
eiving their first dose is March 1 based on the supplies currently available=
, however the date may change as we get closer to FDA approval for other bra=
nds. If you have any questions regarding your vaccine status please utilize =
