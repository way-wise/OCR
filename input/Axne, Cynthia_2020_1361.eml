About Contact Issues Media Services=20
For regular updates on my work in Washington and information on when I=E2=80=99ll=
 be in your neighborhood, sign up here for my e-newsletter. =20

Friends,=20

Last month, Congress authorized direct payments for Iowans to help families=
 deal with the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of those p=
ayments have already reached bank accounts in Iowa, and I wanted to reach ou=
t to provide some new information on direct payments  and give you a quick u=
pdate on what I'm working on.

How Are You Getting Your Direct Payment?=20

The IRS has launched a portal to help those who qualify for a direct paymen=
t. Find it here.=20

As you may already know, the CARES Act authorized direct payments to Iowans=
 to help lessen the financial burdens related to COVID-19.

The amount of the rebate depends on family size. The payment is $1,200 for =
each adult individual ($2,400 for joint filers), and $500 per qualifying chi=
ld under age 17. The advance payment of rebates is reduced by $5 for every $=
100 of income to the extent a  taxpayer=E2=80=99s income exceeds $150,000 for a jo=
int filer, $112,500 for a head of household filer, and $75,000 for anyone el=
se (including single filers).

If you would like to check the status of your direct payment or update your=
 direct deposit information, you can use the IRS' new portal by clicking her=
e.=20

If you do not usually file taxes, but receive Social Security, SSI, or VA b=
enefits, you can still qualify for a payment. You can add your direct deposi=
t information for the IRS to use  for disbursing your direct payment through=
 the portal here.=20

Beware of Scammers Claiming to Be Able to Help You Get Your Direct Payment=20

As direct payments begin to show up in Iowans' bank accounts and mailboxes,=
 please take care when dealing with potential scams that may try to steal pe=
rsonal information  or claim that they can help get you your payment faster.

The IRS is providing updates on the status of direct payments =E2=80=93 but it wi=
ll never contact you seeking to verify personal information. If someone clai=
ming to be the IRS, the Treasury Department, or an agency that is seeking to=
 expedite your payment contacts  you =E2=80=93 hang up!

Tell your friends and family to watch not only for emails but text messages=
, websites and social media attempts that request money or personal informat=
ion.

If you do encounter a scam attempt, do not try to engage them online or on =
the phone. Learn more about reporting suspected scams by going to the Report=
  Phishing and Online Scams page on IRS.gov.=20

Join My Next Coronavirus Telephone Town Hall=20

Over the last few weeks, I've been speaking with Iowa business owners, heal=
th care professionals, educators, and local emergency managers on my Virtual=
 District Tour  =E2=80=93 and they've been sharing with me the burdens they're fee=
ling from the coronavirus outbreak in Iowa.

Hearing directly from Iowans allows me to know what to prioritize as Congre=
ss works on the next pieces of legislation to respond to this crisis. I hope=
 that you can join me next week on Wednesday,  April 29th at 12:50pm CT for =
my next coronavirus telephone town hall.=20

You can ask questions about legislation we've passed, direct payments, test=
ing, or assistance programs available for Iowa.

Sign up to join the town hall at: axne.house.gov/live=20

You can join the call at 12:50p next Wednesday by calling: 866-295-1715=20

Securing More Funding for Small Businesses and Rural Communities=20

This week, Congress is working on emergency legislation to quickly provide =
additional funding to help Iowa small businesses, protect our hospitals, and=
 expand testing capabilities to  put us on a path to responsibly reopening o=
ur state.

I'm glad that we're allocating another $321 billion for the Paycheck Protec=
tion Program =E2=80=93 which has been helping Iowa businesses stay afloat and keep=
 their employees on payroll =E2=80=93 and that we're reserving $60 billion in that=
 program specifically for smaller  community banks to make sure that our mom=
-and-pop shops and rural businesses have the same access to loans as larger =
urban businesses. The bill also provides funding to support an additional $3=
50 billion of Economic Injury Disaster Loans to provide additional  loans fo=
r small businesses to go beyond payroll.

The bill making its way through Congress this week also has $75 billion for=
 hospitals and $25 billion to help expand testing for coronavirus.

As we finalize this funding, we will move forward with negotiating addition=
al legislation that will help states and local governments deal with the gro=
wing costs of fighting this pandemic, protect our health care and frontline =
emergency response workers, and  invest in infrastructure and rural broadban=
d connectivity to help Iowa recover more quickly from the economic effects o=
f the outbreak.

If you have a provision that you'd like to see included in our next bill, w=
rite to me and tell me the help that your community needs: axne.house.gov/co=
ntact/email-me

I look forward to hearing from you!=20

Thank you,=20

This week, Congress is working on emergency legislation to quickly provide a=
dditional funding to help Iowa small businesses, protect our hospitals, and =
expand testing capabilities to
 put us on a path to responsibly reopening our state.<br>
<br>
I'm glad that we're allocating another $321 billion for the Paycheck Protec=
tion Program =E2=80=93 which has been helping Iowa businesses stay afloat and keep=
 their employees on payroll =E2=80=93 and that we're reserving $60 billion in that=
 program specifically for smaller
 community banks to make sure that our mom-and-pop shops and rural business=
es have the same access to loans as larger urban businesses. The bill also p=
rovides funding to support an additional $350 billion of Economic Injury Dis=
aster Loans to provide additional
 loans for small businesses to go beyond payroll.<br>
<br>
The bill making its way through Congress this week also has $75 billion for=
 hospitals and $25 billion to help expand testing for coronavirus.<br>
<br>
As we finalize this funding, we will move forward with negotiating addition=
al legislation that will help states and local governments deal with the gro=
wing costs of fighting this pandemic, protect our health care and frontline =
emergency response workers, and
 invest in infrastructure and rural broadband connectivity to help Iowa rec=
over more quickly from the economic effects of the outbreak.<br>
<br>
If you have a provision that you'd like to see included in our next bill, w=
rite to me and tell me the help that your community needs:</span><span style=
