Dear Friend,

This week lawmakers did not convene for legislative activity, but President=
 Biden addressed a sparsely attended joint session of Congress to report on =
the first 100 days of his administration, and his plans for the future.

I was disappointed that the President did not come clean with the American =
people about the humanitarian catastrophe that his pro-illegal immigration p=
olicies have created along our southern border. Even worse, he offered no pl=
an for how to bring this dangerous and rapidly worsening situation under con=
trol.

The speech was also a reality check for many Americans.  After promising re=
peatedly to seek =E2=80=9Cunity,=E2=80=9D President Biden has instead pursued a radical =
agenda =E2=80=93 one that has sought to divide America along political and racial =
lines, demonize the men and women of law enforcement, and ignore an alarming=
 wave of crime, violence and lawlessness that is becoming a way of life for =
many American cities.

On the economic front, the President announced yet another multi-trillion d=
ollar spending proposal that would further expand the bloated federal welfar=
e state =E2=80=93 this one with a price tag of some $2 trillion. Yet in the next b=
reath, he blamed the tax reductions approved in 2017 for today=E2=80=99s skyrocket=
ing national debt.

For those of you keeping track, this new spending plan adds to the more tha=
n $2 trillion =E2=80=9Cstimulus=E2=80=9D bill the President already signed into law =E2=80=93 =
and the roughly $3 trillion =E2=80=9Cinfrastructure=E2=80=9D bill he has already sent up=
 to Congress (which dedicates only around 6 percent of that total to roads a=
nd bridges). Taken together, these three proposals alone will cost taxpayers=
 a whopping $7 trillion dollars =E2=80=93 and this is before Congress even begins =
to consider the regular spending bills that fund annual government operation=
s (those will likely cost taxpayers another $4 trillion dollars).

President Biden has promised repeatedly to =E2=80=9CBuild Back Better,=E2=80=9D yet his=
 first acts as President were to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and strangl=
e the American energy development that our manufacturing sector depends on =E2=
=80=93 killing jobs and hammering Americans with soaring gas prices at the pump.

We also heard the president call for increasing the top marginal income tax=
 rate to nearly 40 percent, and 30 percent hike in the corporate rate =E2=80=93 ev=
en as millions of American workers, families and businesspeople continue to =
struggle under the weight of government-imposed lockdowns. =20

These policies won=E2=80=99t just squeeze family budgets, they represent a return=
 to the kind of failed high-tax, job-killing, big-spending policies that str=
angled our economy during the Obama years and exported American jobs and fac=
tories to countries like China.=20

In short, the last 100 days have not been what many Americans expected, and=
 they have set the tone for an administration that we simply can=E2=80=99t afford.=
=20

I hope we can work together in Congress across party lines in the coming we=
eks and months to restore some basic checks-and-balances to our government, =
find ways to address problems like the border crisis, and get serious about =
expanding opportunity for American families =E2=80=93 not the budgets and bureaucr=
acies in Washington, DC.

Thanks for checking in with us this week, and we hope you enjoy this Friday=
=E2=80=99s edition of the Telegram!

Sincerely,

=20

Critical Race Theory: Your tax dollars at work=20
Telegram readers have seen our updates on some of the troubling steps Democ=
rats on Capitol Hill have taken to polarize America along racial lines. From=
 House Judiciary Committee approval of a =E2=80=9Creparations commission,=E2=80=9D to a =
Senator from a neighboring state declaring she would only vote for =E2=80=9Cminori=
ty=E2=80=9D nominees, it seems like every day there is some new push to stop treat=
ing Americans as unique individuals, and start treating them based on their =
skin color. The Biden administration now appears headed further down that un=
fortunate road =E2=80=93 and is reportedly planning to spend taxpayer money to inj=
ect radical, race-based theories into history class curriculum. This project=
 would indoctrinate our students with the false and inflammatory claim that =
America=E2=80=99s founding =E2=80=93 and even our war for independence from the British =
Empire =E2=80=93 were simply tools to expand slavery. You can read more about this=
 dangerous proposal here.

Equal opportunity challenge filed against race-based USDA program =20
Many of you have been keeping an eye on the Agriculture Civil Rights and Eq=
uality or ACRE Act, legislation Rep. Burgess Owens and I introduced last mon=
th to block a USDA program signed into law by President Biden. The Biden pro=
gram would provide debt relief to farmers based solely on the basis of race.=
 This week, our efforts got a boost when farmers in multiple states, Wiscons=
in, Minnesota, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas, challenged the constitutionalit=
y of the program.=20

Coming soon: Subsidized high-rise apartments in the suburbs?=20
A little-known feature of President Biden=E2=80=99s massive =E2=80=9Cinfrastructure=E2=80=9D =
package would take aim at neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes by off=
ering federal money to local governments if they agree to pave the way for c=
onstruction of high-density apartment blocks in suburbs.  Some of you rememb=
er that former President Trump and Former Housing and Urban Development Secr=
etary Ben Carson warned that Democrats would pursue such a plan in a newspap=
er column last summer. I am opposed to this idea and believe we=E2=80=99d all be a=
 lot better off if Washington, D.C. bureaucrats kept their noses out of loca=
l neighborhood planning decisions.

Breaking China=E2=80=99s grip on the WHO=20
On Tuesday I joined several of my colleagues in voicing opposition to Taiwa=
n=E2=80=99s continued exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO).  For yea=
rs, the WHO has been under Beijing=E2=80=99s thumb, undermining global public heal=
th efforts and silencing China=E2=80=99s critics =E2=80=93 including Taiwan. Readers may=
 recall that Taiwan tried to alert the WHO about person-to-person transmissi=
on of the Wuhan coronavirus back in December of 2019=E2=80=93 before the pandemic =
swept across the globe. Unfortunately, the WHO ignored those warnings to pro=
tect Communist China, and we know what happened next.  China=E2=80=99s domination =
of the WHO is unfair, unwise, and unhealthy =E2=80=93 and it needs to come to an e=
nd. I=E2=80=99ve long advocated for closer U.S. ties with our friends in Taiwan, a=
nd I hope in the coming year we can work across party lines to deepen the fr=
iendship between our two nations =E2=80=93 and reform the beleaguered WHO. You can=
 listen to my statement on Taiwan=E2=80=99s exclusion from the WHO here.

                          Committee Update
Natural Resources Committee Update=20
On Thursday the Natural Resources Committee had a National Parks, Forests, =
and Public Lands Subcommittee hearing on wildfires. I made the point that th=
e wildfire problem in the western states is primarily a forest management pr=
oblem. But that isn=E2=80=99t the only negative consequence of poor forest managem=
ent.  In Wisconsin, timber harvest has been significantly reduced on the Che=
quamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF) over the last thirty years =E2=80=93 costi=
ng taxpayers a bundle. In fact, it has cost the federal treasury $250 millio=
n =E2=80=93 exacerbating the budget deficit, reducing wildlife diversity, and kill=
ing jobs as mills that depend on the harvests closed their doors. We also se=
e increased risks of fire from the blowdown of mature trees that should have=
 been harvested years earlier in the Diamond Roof area in Langlade, Forest a=
nd Oconto Counties. One of the witnesses, invited by the majority, made the =
claim that =E2=80=9Clarge trees are more fire and drought resistant and store and =
accumulate more carbon annually than small trees.=E2=80=9D This statement is paten=
tly incorrect, in fact the older trees get, the rate at which they sequester=
 slows down, and when they die that carbon is released back into the atmosph=
ere. That is why it is important we practice active forest management =E2=80=93 no=
t a neglectful =E2=80=9Chands-off=E2=80=9D policy that leaves forests to become overgrow=
n and packed with dead trees, creating tinderbox conditions that make wildfi=
res more likely.

                            District Update
COVID/Vaccine Update=20
Wisconsin continues to see a decline in daily case numbers, with an average=
 of 612 reported cases each day. Hospitalizations remain stable throughout t=
he state, although the North Central HERC region did experience an increase =
in COVID admissions in the past two weeks. On the variant front, Wisconsin i=
s still seeing significant numbers of B117 (UK) and B1427 (California) being=
 reported throughout the state with 707 and 394 total reported cases respect=
ively.=20

On the vaccine side, Wisconsin reached 4.3 million doses administered, and =
nearly 2 million people have received their second dose and are fully vaccin=
ated. Additionally, this week the CDC and FDA lifted their temporary pause o=
n the Johnson & Johnson vaccine following an investigation for reported even=
ts of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Both the CDC and FDA =
concluded the benefits of the vaccination far outweigh the risks with only 1=
5 people out of more than 8 million recipients ever showing signs of TTS. Th=
ey do encourage women under the age of 50 to consider all available vaccine =
options as TTS has largely been traced to that demographic in clinical setti=
ngs.=20

New Studies and Announcements on Masking=20
This week the CDC also presented new guidance for vaccinated individuals, a=
llowing them to go without masks in most outdoor settings. You can find that=
 guidance here. This announcement leads me into another conversation regardi=
ng mask wearing=E2=80=94mask mandates in schools. Many schools throughout the stat=
e have begun removing mask mandates in classroom settings, a major milestone=
 in bringing our children back to a state of normalcy.=20

I also wanted to highlight a study conducted by Baruch Vainshelboim, a clin=
ical exercise physiologist, which shows the negative impacts mask-wearing ca=
n have on our health. The research shows mask wearing can raise heart rate a=
nd arterial oxygen pressure when worn for more than 60 minutes. Additionally=
, cloth masks have shown to provide poor filtration and increased moisture r=
etention, which in some cases leads to increased risk of respiratory infecti=
on. The most critical point in my opinion was Vainshelboim=E2=80=99s discussion of=
 the psychological and emotional impact of never seeing another person=E2=80=99s m=
outh in a conversation setting. For our children, this has created a detrime=
ntal impact on social development in the classroom that needs to be addresse=
d. It is clear the masks are ready to come off, and Wisconsin students are r=
eady to learn fully face-to-face once again. =20

                                  Resources  =20
The USDA continues to make resources and assistance available to agricultur=
al producers and working families to ensure access, safety and stability for=
 food markets and supplies.=20

Small businesses can also apply for assistance through the Economic Injury =
and Disaster Loan program. This program provides economic relief to business=
es that are currently experiencing a temporary loss of revenue as a result o=
f the pandemic.

e only negative consequence of poor forest management.&nbsp; In Wisconsin, t=
imber harvest has been significantly reduced on the Chequamegon-Nicolet Nati=
onal Forest (CNNF) over the last thirty years =E2=80=93 costing taxpayers a bundle=
. In fact, it has cost the federal treasury $250 million =E2=80=93 exacerbating th=
e budget deficit, reducing wildlife diversity, and killing jobs as mills tha=
t depend on the harvests closed their doors. We also see increased risks of =
fire from the blowdown of mature trees that should have been harvested years=
 earlier in the Diamond Roof area in Langlade, Forest and Oconto Counties. O=
ne of the witnesses, invited by the majority, made the claim that =E2=80=9Clarge t=
rees are more fire and drought resistant and store and accumulate more carbo=
n annually than small trees.=E2=80=9D This statement is patently incorrect, in fac=
t the older trees get, the rate at which they sequester slows down, and when=
 they die that carbon is released back into the atmosphere. That is why it i=

ds-off=E2=80=9D policy that leaves forests to become overgrown and packed with dea=
d trees, creating tinderbox conditions that make wildfires more likely.<br><=
