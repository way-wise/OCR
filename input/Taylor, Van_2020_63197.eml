Coronavirus Update
Travel, Health, and Employment Guidance 
As your Representative, I am fully committed to combatting coronavirus (COVID-19) and am actively engaged with local, state, and federal health officials.

Last night, President Trump addressed the nation and outlined additional plans to combat coronavirus. As this is a rapidly evolving situation, I wanted to reach out with additional resources for those impacted by this virus. You can also find frequent updates on my website. 
Below is additional information about resources available to those negatively impacted by the coronavirus. Should you  have any questions or concerns, please contact my office.

Travel Assistance
On Wednesday, March 11, 2020, President Trump announced new travel restrictions for non-U.S. citizens who have visited the 26-nation Schengen Area within the last 14 days. These new travel restrictions will go into effect at midnight tomorrow, Friday, March 13, 2020. While American citizens are exempt from the travel restrictions, there may be some difficulty in finding commercial airline availability.

Travelers are urged to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate or call the following numbers: 1(888) 407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and  Canada) or 1 (202) 501-4444 from other countries or jurisdictions.

Those currently traveling abroad or those with planned trips should review CDC Travel Health Notices and international travel guidance issued by the Department of State. All Department of State updates on coronavirus can be found online.

Should you need assistance navigating international travel policy, or have questions about domestic travel, please contact my office at (972) 202-4150.

Assistance for Workers
Following the President's address, the U.S. Department of Labor announced new guidance outlining flexibilities that states have in administering their unemployment insurance (UI) programs to assist Americans affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. More information  on guidance from the Department of Labor can be found here.

Support for Businesses
The White House has instructed the Small Business Administration (SBA) to exercise available authority to provide loans to businesses affected by the coronavirus. These loans will help overcome disruptions caused by the coronavirus. More information about SBA  programs, such as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, can be found here.

Small businesses are encouraged to do their part to keep their employees, customers, and themselves healthy. Visit the CDC's Guide for Businesses and Employers to learn more about planning, preparing, and responding to coronavirus.

Washington Tours
To aid ongoing efforts to combat coronavirus and in consultation with the Office of the Attending Physician, the Sergeant of Arms has closed the United States Capitol to all tours until April 1, 2020. As a result, our office is unable to provide previously  scheduled tours at this time. Should you have any additional questions, please contact my office via email or phone at (202) 225-4201.

Prevention and Signs
While reports indicate treatments to treat COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, should be available soon, there is currently no vaccine for coronavirus and the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. While  the CDC reports that the immediate risk to average, healthy Americans remains low, it's important for communities and families to take the necessary steps, like washing your hands and staying home if you're sick, to avoid spreading the virus. More information can be found at CDC.gov. If you think you may have coronavirus, contact your healthcare provider for guidance.

Please subscribe to continue receiving official updates on coronavirus from my office.

It is a privilege to serve you in the United States House of Representatives. I will continue to closely monitor this situation and update you on any changes as we work together to keep Americans safe and healthy.

Semper Fidelis,

Van Taylor
