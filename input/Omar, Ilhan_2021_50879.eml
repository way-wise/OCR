The House Passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act
Dear friends,=20


As the trial of Derek Chauvin begins next week, I wanted to share some of t=
he work we are doing on the federal level to combat police brutality. From G=
eorge Floyd to Jamar Clark to Philando Castile=E2=80=94our communities have felt t=
he pain of injustice for far too long. It is time for us to not only provide=
 justice to these families, but to everyone else who has experienced injusti=
ce within our criminal justice system. This week, the House took action and =
passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.=20
=20
This legislation will eliminate qualified immunity for law enforcement, ban=
 chokeholds, and mandate data collection on police encounters. This is an im=
portant step in the right direction, but we can=E2=80=99t stop here. We must heed =
the calls from those who are impacted by police brutality daily and reimagin=
e public safety in this country. Last month, we celebrated Black History Mon=
th and honored the contributions of countless Black Minnesotans whose triump=
hs made our communities better. I know this legislation will not solve all o=
f the challenges we face, but it is a step in the right direction to actuall=
y making Black Lives Matter.=20

In the District =20

In the first couple of months of my second term, we have been focusing on o=
ur commitment to co-governance. I have met with St. Louis Park and Golden Va=
lley City Councils as part of my visits to all city councils in the district=
. I have also started holding regular meetings with different constituency g=
roups to ensure that I am representing all of the diverse voices within our =
district. You can read more about my meetings here. =20

Fighting for Survival Checks =20

=20

 =20

In February, I led a letter to the Biden Administration urging for the incl=
usion of recurring cash payments to the American people for the duration of =
pandemic. The letter also calls for parity of payments for adults and depend=
ents=E2=80=94and inclusion of all immigrant workers and their families. You can re=
ad more about my efforts here=20

 =20

 =20

Fighting for Election Reform =20

This week, the House passed HR 1, legislation to end the culture of corrupt=
ion in Washington. The bill ends the dominance of big money in politics, pro=
tects the right to vote, and strengthens campaign finance oversight. I also =
introduced the PAUL Act to make sure that lobbyists representing foreign cou=
ntries act in good faith and operate with full transparency. You can read mo=
re here. =20

 =20

Fighting for  Student Debt Cancellation =20

=20

Student debt is the result of a broken system that tells students to get an=
 education and go to college in order to have a stable life=E2=80=94but doesn=E2=80=99t =
provide the resources to afford that education. I co-led a resolution with S=
enate Majority Leader Schumer and Senator Warren urging President Bident to =
cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt. I will continue to push for the f=
ull cancellation of student debt. You can watch my remarks from a press conf=
erence on this topic here. =20

 =20

Fighting for Human Rights Everywhere=20

Upholding basic human rights around the world is a core priority for me and=
 the Fifth District of Minnesota. This week, I introduced a bill to sanction=
 Mohammed bin Salman for his role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and grave=
 human rights abuses. I was also named Vice Chair of the Foreign Affairs Sub=
committee on Africa. This will give me the opportunity to play a leadership =
role in overseeing our international aid and foreign policy on the African c=
ontinent. You can read my statement here. =20

Fighting for a Livable Planet =20

=20
Last month, I visited Line 3 and met with the indigenous communities who wo=
uld be directly impacted by it. This proposed tar sands pipeline project is =
projected to add five times as much greenhouse gas annually as Minnesota tra=
nsportation produced in total in 2016. I led a letter to President Biden urg=
ing him to stop the construction of Line 3. You can watch a video from my vi=
sit here. =20

 =20

 =20

Fighting for Accountability  =20

On January 6th, we all watched as gunmen stormed the Capitol in an effort t=
o overturn the election results. I introduced articles of impeachment agains=
t Donald Trump for his incitement of violence and orchestrating an attempted=
 coup against our country. You can read my full statement here. =20

 =20

Fighting for the 5th =20

My office is here to help if you need assistance with Medicare, Social Secu=
rity, the VA, Immigration, or any other federal agency. Please contact my Di=
strict Office at (612) 333=E2=80=931272 whenever we can be of service. I wanted to=
 share this story about=20
Vince and his experience working with my office:=20

=E2=80=9CI really can't thank you enough. I have no doubt that it was your timely=
 attention to my problem that moved it a few more steps closer to a positive=
 resolution. You knew exactly who to approach and how to approach them. I'm =
sure the actual resolution of my fraud problem will take more time, but I do=
n't believe for a minute that I would be this far without your help. And don=
e for someone you had never met. In all of this you were direct, articulate,=
 and polite. I always felt you were on my side, and that alone gave me cause=
 for optimism.=E2=80=9D Vince, Minneapolis. =20
