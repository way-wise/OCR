 Representative Trahan is joined in Acton, Massachusetts with seniors to di=
scuss legislation before  congress related to Social Security and Medicare.=20


Friend --

I care about our Seniors. One of my top priorities in Congress is advocatin=
g on behalf of important issues that impact our senior citizens.  =20

=20

Growing up, my dad was a union ironworker my mom worked multiple part-time =
jobs to help raise my three sisters and me. I know first-hand the importance=
 of fighting to protect federal programs that put the interests of  working =
families ahead of tax cuts for the wealthy.

That's why I am fighting to protect Social Security, expand Medicare, defen=
d protections for people with preexisting conditions, lower prescription dru=
g prices, and ensure that Americans can retire with both their dignity and t=
heir pensions intact.=20

In the service of those goals, I=E2=80=99ve been proud to be working on some of t=
he following pieces of legislation in Washington:=20

The Older Americans Act (OAA)
Originally passed in 1965, funding for the Older Americans Act (OAA) has no=
t kept pace with the growth of the American population over the age of 60. I=
n 2010, OAA funding was $42.95 per senior in today=E2=80=99s dollars. Today, it is=
 just $27.25 per senior. I  am committed to increasing funding for critical =
services and care to aging Americans and will be supporting this bill when i=
t comes up for a vote.=20

Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019=20
Currently, prescription drug companies often charge Americans three, four, =
or even ten times more for their prescriptions than what they charge for the=
 same drugs in other countries. The Lower Drug Costs Now Act would level the=
 playing field for American patients  and taxpayers by giving all Americans =
access to lower drug prices negotiated by the federal government. =20

=20

The SECURE Act of 2019

The SECURE Act of 2019 is a major piece of bipartisan legislation that will=
 benefit seniors throughout the country if signed into law. This bill would =
expand and preserve retirement savings, provide administrative  improvements=
 to the IRS and related agencies, as well as improve revenue provisions for =
retirement.

=20

The Social Security 2100 Act

The Social Security 2100 Act will strengthen the Social Security program by=
 giving beneficiaries a boost in their monthly benefits, while assuring the =
program is stable and sufficient for current and future generations.=20

=20

Social Security Fairness Act

The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal the Government Pension Offset=
 and the Windfall Elimination Provision, provision which is short-changing b=
eneficiaries. We must ensure fairness when it comes to government  employees=
 like teachers, firefighters, and police officers accessing the benefits the=
y=E2=80=99ve earned.=20

=20

Disability Integration Act

This legislation prohibits the government from denying community-based serv=
ices to individuals with disabilities that require long-term service. This b=
ill requires government entities and insurance providers to provide  communi=
ty-based services to individuals with such disabilities. These regulations a=
lso require the government to ensure affordable, accessible, and integrated =
housing that is not disability-accessible, providing seniors a better qualit=
y of life.

The Strengthening Health Care and Lower Prescription Drug Costs Act

I was proud to support this legislation, which also passed in the House of =
Representatives. This bill takes major steps toward making prescription drug=
s more affordable. It targets generic drug =E2=80=9Cparking,=E2=80=9D ensuring  that gen=
eric drugs get to the market faster than they have in the past. It also bans=
 brand-name drug manufacturers from making agreements to delay generic produ=
cts from entering the market.

 and meet folks in their own communities. I am fighting to make our governme=
nt work better by focusing on the issues that matter. Please do not hesitate=

I've traveled across the district to visit senior centers, host town halls,=
 and meet folks in their own communities. I am fighting to make our governme=
nt work better by focusing on the issues that matter. Please do not hesitate=
 to contact me with questions
 and comments, or if there's a problem you need our help solving. &nbsp;</s=
