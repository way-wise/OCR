Beatty Boosts Bill Cutting Taxes for Families with Children
Congresswoman Beatty cosponsors the American Family Act

U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) is joining forces with a group of l=
eading Members of Congress and Senators to reintroduce the American Family A=
ct of 2021, a measure to overhaul and strengthen the Child Tax Credit (CTC) =
to provide families with children the much-needed financial resources to wea=
ther COVID-19=E2=80=99s financial storm. Based on research from the Columbia Unive=
rsity Center on Poverty and Social Policy, the American Family Act would cut=
 child poverty by 38 percent.

g families buy groceries, afford rent, and purchase the essentials they need=
, but the bill will also raise millions out of poverty in the long-term.=E2=80=9D=20

If enacted, the American Family Act would:
Increase CTC to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for a child under six;
make the payments monthly ($250 and $300 for children under six);
authorize the credit to be fully refundable, helping the one-third of famil=
ies left out of the credit now to access the full benefit;=20
and allow 17-year-olds to be eligible.
