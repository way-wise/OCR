April 23, 2020 As your Representative in Congress, I wanted to provide you =
with an update on certain provisions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco=
nomic Security (CARES) Act that offer relief for small businesses. Our natio=
n and state face difficult days ahead. COVID-19 cases are expected to peak l=
ater this month before stabilizing and hopefully declining. As we continue o=
ur =E2=80=9Cstay-at-home=E2=80=9D efforts, know that you are not alone. We are all worki=
ng through this together.  The thousands of sacrifices people all across our=
 state are making are reducing the spread of the virus and saving lives. In =
Congress, we understand the toll this is taking on our state. Congress and f=
ederal agencies are doing their best to move at warp speed to get through th=
is difficult time. Our aim is to do everything in our power to protect the p=
hysical and economic health  of people in our communities. On March 27, the =
CARES Act became law. The measures include the following key elements that p=
ertain to Small Businesses:=20
Paycheck Protection Loan Program
Small Business Administration (SBA) backed loans to help small businesses c=
over up to eight weeks of payroll with a short-term loan. If the business ca=
n maintain its full payroll from February 15- June 30, 2020, the loan will b=
e fully forgiven. After $349  billion in loans were approved in just 13 days=
, Congress has authorized additional funding for this popular program to con=
tinue assisting small businesses and their workers.
Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL)
Short term loans designed to cover expenses to businesses experiencing a lo=
ss in revenue due to the national emergency. Small businesses are eligible f=
or both this loan and a Paycheck Protection Loan as long as the EIDL covers =
a different business expense.
SBA Debt Relief
SBA will pay the principal and interest on new 7(a) loans issued before Sep=
tember 27, 2020.
SBA will also pay the principal and interest on existing 7(a) loans for six=
 months.
Small Business Contracting Guarantees
The federal government will continue its current contractual obligations to=
 small businesses during the national emergency.
Paid Family Leave Tax Credit
To cover the cost of the paid family/medical/sick leave mandate, small and =
midsize businesses are eligible for a 100% tax credit on the costs of provid=
ing it.
Entrepreneurial Development Programs
Funding and grants to programs for providing training, counseling, and assi=
stance for small businesses, with a focus on minority-owned and new business=
es.=20
Our nation has faced unexpected and tremendous challenges throughout our hi=
story and we have always endured. This will be no exception. The resilience =
of our communities, the decency of our people and the strength of our faith =
will help us persevere. Please  stay connected with our office by visiting o=
ur website at estes.house.gov/coronavirus, and do not hesitate to contact ou=
r office with any further questions or comments regarding COVID-19. Sincerel=
y,
