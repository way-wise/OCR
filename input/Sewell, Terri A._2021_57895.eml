  June 29, 2021   HELP IS HERE FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN!   Dear Christ=
opher Kosteva,   The past year has been a challenging one in so many ways. I=
 know that families across the country, and especially here in Alabama=E2=80=99s 7=
th District, were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding ec=
onomic crisis. Many lost their homes, jobs, and even their loved ones.

I want you to know what I have been doing in Washington to help rescue our =
country from these compounding crises and build back better.

On February 27th, I proudly cast my vote in favor of the $1.9 trillion Amer=
ican Rescue Plan, a transformational piece of legislation that represents th=
e most robust investment in the American people in generations. This legisla=
tion was designed to rescue our country from the devastation caused by the C=
OVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis.=20
=20
With the American Rescue Plan, help is finally here! Today, all over our Na=
tion, the American Rescue Plan is getting shots in arms, money in pockets, p=
eople in jobs, and kids safely in schools.=20

That=E2=80=99s why I spent the spring meeting with constituents, seniors, small b=
usinesses, and local officials as a part of my American Rescue Plan District=
 Tour to highlight the critical assistance that is now available.=20

Click here for a recap of my American Rescue Plan District Tour.=20

As your Congresswoman, I am committed to ensuring that you are aware of the=
 many resources available to you. Keep reading to find out how the American =
Rescue Plan will help you and your community!=20

  THE EXPANDED AND IMPROVED CHILD TAX CREDIT=20

I know that many parents, grandparents, and guardians in Alabama have been =
struggling to afford food, child care, health care, and other necessities du=
ring this pandemic.

That=E2=80=99s why I fought hard to include an expansion of the Child Tax Credit =
in the American Rescue Plan. Now, parents and guardians all over the country=
 will be receiving monthly payments of up to $300 per child beginning July 1=
5th! This transformational policy will benefit 93.5% of children in Alabama=E2=
=80=99s 7th District and is projected to cut child poverty in the United States =
in HALF.

The Child Tax Credit is now fully refundable, which means that even if you =
make no income or very little, you will still receive the full benefit. Near=
ly all families with children qualify for the payments. Families that do not=
 normally file taxes can sign up through the IRS=E2=80=99 non-filer portal here. F=
or more information about the Child Tax Credit, including answers to commonl=
y asked questions, click here.

I recently hosted a TerriTalk with Carol Gundlach from Alabama Arise about =
how you can take advantage of the Child Tax Credit. Watch it here!
 =20

THE EXPANDED EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT =20

The American Rescue Plan provides much needed relief for low-income workers=
 by tripling the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit benefit for workers withou=
t children from roughly $540 to roughly $1,500. It also raises the income ca=
p for these adults to qualify from about $16,000 to at least $21,000.

Just like the Child Tax Credit, workers must file federal income taxes to t=
ake advantage of the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit. Click here for more =
information.=20

 =20

 =20

EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE=20

Are you having trouble paying your rent or utility bills? The American Resc=
ue Plan provides an additional $21.6 billion for an Emergency Rental Assista=
nce program to help renters pay their bills during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eligible tenants must meet the following criteria:=20
Have a valid rental agreement in their name
Household=E2=80=99s total gross income cannot exceed 80% Area Median Income for l=
ocation
The household has experienced a loss of income due to COVID-19, such as une=
mployment, reduced working hours, inability to find childcare during the pan=
demic, or loss of spousal/child support.
Funds are being disbursed at the local level and Alabamians can find out mo=
re about the availability and application process by visiting my website her=
e.


ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES=20

Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, and I=E2=80=99m proud that =
the American Rescue Plan provides billions of dollars to help them weather t=
his pandemic by:
Expanding the SBA=E2=80=99s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
Expanding the SBA=E2=80=99s Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program
Creating a new SBA Restaurant Revitalization Fund
Creating a new SBA Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program
=20

ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS=20

This pandemic has made clear what we already know: Our children learn best =
in the classroom. But getting our kids back in schools safely requires fundi=
ng and coordination.=20

The American Rescue Plan provides $122 billion to K-12 public schools in th=
e United States including roughly $2 billion to K-12 schools in Alabama. Thi=
s funding will be used to make schools safer with:=20
Smaller class sizes
More social distancing
New ventilation systems
More staff
The American Rescue Plan also provides more than $584 million to colleges a=
nd universities in Alabama and over $163 million to those in our district to=
 recover from the pandemic and help students afford higher education. Studen=
ts should contact their educational institutions for information about how t=
o obtain these funds.=20

=20


ASSISTANCE FOR SENIORS=20

Older Alabamians were hit particularly hard by the pandemic and were more l=
ikely than younger Alabamians to become severely ill from COVID-19.=20

Check out the MILLIONS of dollars that Alabama will be receiving through th=
e American Rescue Plan to give our seniors the care they deserve.=20


DEBT RELIEF FOR BLACK FARMERS=20

The American Rescue Plan includes two provisions to provide needed relief t=
o Black, Indigenous, and Farmers of Color.=20

First, the bill provides $4 billion in debt relief for certain USDA farm lo=
ans. =20

Second, $1 billion is allocated to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to pr=
ovide training, technical assistance and other assistance to black farmers a=
nd other farmers of color, as well as community-based organizations and the =
1890 and 1994 Land Grants and other minority serving institutions.

Recently, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that halts the US=
DA from making debt relief payments under Section 1005 of the American Rescu=
e Plan Act. Farmers with questions can find more information here.


DIRECT FUNDING FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS=20

Alabama=E2=80=99s cities and counties have been on the front lines in the fight a=
gainst the COVID-19 pandemic, and they need direct assistance to develop loc=
al vaccination plans, pay frontline employees overtime and hazard pay, offse=
t revenue losses, bolster economic recovery, and continue to offer essential=
 services to our families and neighbors.

The American Rescue Plan provides about 2.1 billion to the state of Alabama=
 and 1.7 billion to our counties, cities, and towns to keep our communities =
functioning. Click here to see the full breakdown.


CONSTITUENT CONNECTION: LENDING A HELPING HAND=20

My office continues to be at your service should you need assistance. Take,=
 for example, the story of Mr. James Washington of Pickens County:

After filing an unemployment claim in February, Mr. Washington was informed=
 that the Alabama Department of Labor needed additional information from his=
 previous employer before he could begin receiving assistance. He spent week=
s trying to file claims and repeatedly calling the DOL to no avail. After my=
 office received a letter from Mr. Washington asking for assistance, my staf=
f intervened and contacted the Department on his behalf. Within a week, Mr. =
Washington began receiving his benefits.

=E2=80=9CA few days later, I looked at my phone and I couldn=E2=80=99t believe what I s=
aw,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Washington. =E2=80=9CEverything that was in red that was pending w=
as in green, and I thank you all so much. God was in the plan first of all b=
ut you all were next in line. I do not believe to this day that if I hadn=E2=80=99=
t written you all a letter and you all didn't get involved I don=E2=80=99t think i=
t would've been solved. I think it would=E2=80=99ve still been going. You all did =
a wonderful job and I thank you all so much.=E2=80=9D

Should you need assistance, please do not hesitate to call one of my distri=
ct offices where my friendly staff will be happy to answer your questions or=
 connect you with a caseworker. Phone numbers for each of my offices are lis=
ted on my website.=20


It has been a difficult year, but thanks to the American Rescue Plan, there=
 is finally light at the end of the tunnel. As your Congresswoman, I will co=
ntinue to make every effort to ensure that you know about the critical resou=
rces available to you as we put this pandemic behind us.

Please be sure to check in regularly with our website and social media page=
s (Twitter, Facebook and Instagram) for updates.

As always, take good care. I look forward to hearing from you.=20

Sincerely,=20

Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell=20

br><br>My office continues to be at your service should you need assistance.=
 Take, for example, the story of Mr. James Washington of Pickens County:<br>=
<br>After filing an unemployment claim in February, Mr. Washington was infor=
med that the Alabama Department of Labor needed additional information from =
his previous employer before he could begin receiving assistance. He spent w=
eeks trying to file claims and repeatedly calling the DOL to no avail. After=
 my office received a letter from Mr. Washington asking for assistance, my s=
taff intervened and contacted the Department on his behalf. Within a week, M=
r. Washington began receiving his benefits.<br><br>=E2=80=9CA few days later, I lo=
oked at my phone and I couldn=E2=80=99t believe what I saw,=E2=80=9D said Mr. Washington=
. =E2=80=9CEverything that was in red that was pending was in green, and I thank y=
ou all so much. God was in the plan first of all but you all were next in li=
ne. I do not believe to this day that if I hadn=E2=80=99t written you all a letter=
 and you all didn't get involved I don=E2=80=99t think it would've been solved. I =
think it would=E2=80=99ve still been going. You all did a wonderful job and I than=
k you all so much.=E2=80=9D<br><br>Should you need assistance, please do not hesit=
ate to call one of my district offices where my friendly staff will be happy=
