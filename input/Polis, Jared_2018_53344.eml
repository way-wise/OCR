Dear John,
We have over 600 hemp farmers in Colorado at nearly 750 grow areas. Hemp is=
 a burgeoning industry! In 2017 alone, Colorado farmers planted 17,000 acres=
 of hemp. It is being used as a sustainable alternative for fuel, paper, and=
 plastic - and as lotion, medication,  and even ice cream.

Muchof thisgrowth is possible because a few years ago I wasable tohelppass =
a federal law to allow universities and state-run pilot programs to research=
 and develop industrial hemp.

But hemp, like marijuana, isstill classified as Schedule I drug, to my dism=
ay.

There is hopeful news to report though. We are on the verge of another majo=
r legislative breakthrough. The Senate-version of the =E2=80=9CFarm Bill=E2=80=9D specif=
ies that the federal government cannot use federal resources to interfere wi=
th states that have legalized and  regulated hemp. The language is similar t=
o my policy set forward in the Industrial Hemp Farming Act, and I am hopeful=
 it will be accepted by the House of Representatives. If it is,  it would be=
 only the latest step toward finally lifting the federal prohibition on hemp=
.=20

I=E2=80=99m thrilled we are on our way toward accepting hemp as the wonderful his=
toric crop we know it to be.=20
Check out my visit to a hemp farm in Evergreen earlier this summer here.=20

I=E2=80=99m also still feverishly trying to finally end federal attempts to under=
mine our state=E2=80=99s legalization of another part of the cannabis family, mari=
juana.

Since the attorney general rescinded the Cole Memo at the beginning of the =
year, more and more members of Congress (Republicans and Democrats) have spo=
ken out in defense of states that have legalized marijuana. I am attempting =
to push through any and every  possible short-term fix, most recently sponso=
ring the STATES ACT, while also advocating for lifting the federal prohibiti=
on on marijuana once and for all with my Regulate  Marijuana Like Alcohol Ac=
t, which would end federal prohibition once and for all.

I=E2=80=99m hopeful that soon the prohibition on cannabis will be something for t=
he history books (maybe even history books printed on hemp paper!)

If this newsletter was helpful, please sign up to receive them more regular=
ly here.

In addition, please feel free to connect directly with me. If you'd like to=
 get in touch, you can email me any time, call one  of my offices, or send m=
e a note through Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

I greatly look forward to hearing from you!=20
