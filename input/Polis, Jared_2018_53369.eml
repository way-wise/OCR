Dear Friend, We are so fortunate to share planet earth with majestic animal=
s of all kinds, and I consider it an honor to do all I can to give voice to =
the voiceless. I feel particularly proud having earned 100% on a report card=
 from the Defenders of Wildlife, based on my voting record to protect animal=
s. In Laboratories, mice and rabbits are used in experiments, and tens of mi=
llions of them unnecessarily lose their lives to cosmetic testing in painful=
, inhumane fashions. But there are more effective and accurate ways of measu=
ring the effects of cosmetics  on people than force-injecting thousands of t=
imes the human dose into the eyes of rabbits. I'm proud to do my part in sav=
ing lab mice and rabbits from these cruel practices by sponsoring H.R.2790, =
the Humane Cosmetics Act. H.R. 2790 will phase out cosmetic testing on anima=
ls, and replace it with more humane and effective tests. As a lover and frie=
nd of animals, I have sponsored many bills, including legislation to ensure =
that survivors of domestic violence can stay united with their animals when =
they escape abusive situations; to prohibit the import and export of dog and=
 cat meat;  and to condemn the Dog Meat Festival in China. I wish I could sa=
y that my proactive attempts to protect animals have outweighed the rollback=
s. But the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture recently announced the elimination of a=
nimal welfare standards set by the Obama Administration. These standards ens=
ured that  organically-grown livestock had enough space to stand up and turn=
 in their stalls, and to stretch their wings. For the sake of our health and=
 theirs, these livestock should not live in misery.
These practices are beneath us and show a complete indifference to the suff=
ering of others. And they have a very real negative impact on human health. =
We can do better, and I=E2=80=99ll continue to speak and act on behalf of animals,=
 and the people who demand respect for them. If you'd like to get in touch, =
you can email me any time, call one  of my offices, or send me a note throug=
h Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.  I hope to hear from you soon. Yours truly=
