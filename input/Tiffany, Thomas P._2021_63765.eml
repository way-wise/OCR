Dear Friend,

Speaker Pelosi=E2=80=99s playbook for running the House of Representatives is beg=
inning to look a lot like the classic movie Groundhog Day =E2=80=93 another week, =
another package of controversial, outside-the-mainstream bills fast-tracked =
through Congress without committee hearings, no opportunity for Republicans =
to offer amendments, and rubber-stamped by a partisan majority.

This week, while Americans watched chaotic scenes unfold for a second strai=
ght month on the U.S.-Mexico border, Speaker Pelosi and the House majority r=
esponded by passing two far-reaching immigration bills that would grant amne=
sty to some 5 million illegal aliens and cost taxpayers nearly $40 billion =E2=
=80=93 all while doing nothing to restore order on the border or provide assista=
nce to overwhelmed Border Patrol agents facing a human tidal wave of drug sm=
uggling and human trafficking. The situation is so out of control that Presi=
dent Biden=E2=80=99s own Secretary of Homeland Security admitted that we are now i=
n the midst of the worst illegal immigration surge =E2=80=9Cin the last 20 years.=E2=
=80=9D =20

Democrats also doubled down on their relentless effort to undermine the rig=
hts of women and girls by passing an extension of the Violence Against Women=
 Act that includes controversial gender identity provisions that once again =
seek to treat biological males as biological women under federal law (Telegr=
am readers will remember that just weeks ago, Democrats passed legislation t=
hat would allow biological men to compete in women=E2=80=99s sports). This bill wo=
uld go even further by allowing biological men to be housed in shelters for =
abused women. The legislation also included gun control provisions and dange=
rous attacks on religious liberty =E2=80=93 undermining what could have a bipartis=
an effort.

We heard from a lot of you after last week=E2=80=99s report on a major story out =
of Green Bay that involved a partisan political operative bankrolled by Face=
book=E2=80=99s Mark Zuckerberg getting his hands on the keys to the main ballot co=
unting room in last November=E2=80=99s election. So we wanted to share a related s=
tory with you that broke next door in Michigan a few days ago, where a judge=
 ruled that a pre-election order issued by the state=E2=80=99s top election offici=
al was illegal. The ruling came too late to impact last November=E2=80=99s electio=
n, but it nevertheless sets an important precedent going forward as lawmaker=
s in state capitals across the country work to clean up our election systems=
 to restore integrity and trust in our democratic system.=20

Sticking with the election integrity theme, we also wanted to draw your att=
ention to a recent =E2=80=9Ccorrection=E2=80=9D run by the left-wing Washington Post reg=
arding a December story about a phone call between President Trump and the G=
eorgia=E2=80=99s Secretary of State=E2=80=99s office. Well, it turns out their reporting=
 wasn=E2=80=99t exactly truthful. You can read about their belated mea culpa here.

Telephone Town Hall=20
I also wanted to thank those of you who participated on my tele-town hall t=
his week with my colleague Dr. Greg Murphy of North Carolina on Wednesday. W=
e had a great discussion about a wide range of topics, touching on everythin=
g from school reopenings and the border crisis to election integrity and ene=
rgy independence. I always appreciate your willingness to take time out of y=
our day to share your thoughts and questions.



        Thank you to all who joined my Telephone Town Hall this week!      =
  =20
As part of our forum, we surveyed your thoughts on a few different issues d=
uring the call =E2=80=93 and here are the results:  More than 80 percent of you sa=
id you support a full return to high school athletics without masks this yea=
r and that the $1.9 trillion package President Biden signed into law last we=
ek spent too much on non-COVID related pet projects and programs. A majority=
 of you also said that you personally know someone whose child=E2=80=99s well-bein=
g has suffered as a result of school closures.

We hope you had a nice St. Patrick=E2=80=99s Day, and that you enjoy this week=E2=80=99=

                                    Committee Update=20
Natural Resources=20
The Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources had a he=
aring Thursday on abandoned mines, local economies, and the environment. Spe=
cifically, the Committee was considering three bills related to mining recla=
mation. One of those, H.R. 1734 would reauthorize the Abandoned Mine Land (A=
ML) Reclamation Fee, which was established in 1977 and is collected on every=
 ton of coal produced. The money goes towards the cleanup of historic abando=
ned mine land sites. It is important to note that for the cleanup of these s=
ites to continue, the coal industry must remain healthy. When Congress takes=
 steps to harm the prosperity of our energy industry, their ability to pay t=
he fees suffers.  As a result, funding for efforts =E2=80=93 such as environmental=
 conservation =E2=80=93 suffer as well. Fees to clean up these abandoned mine site=
s are dependent on the coal industry in the same way that maintenance effort=
s on public lands depend on fees generated by oil and gas leases for the Lan=
d and Water Conservation Fund. By punishing the energy industry with heavy-h=
anded regulations and crushing taxes, we harm the people who generate the mo=
ney we rely on for environmental protection programs.=20

                                     Legislative Update=20
The SHINE Act=20
This week, I co-authored the Securing Honesty In National Elections (SHINE)=
 Act. This legislation will require everyone to provide a valid photo identi=
fication to vote in federal elections and assist in providing photo IDs to t=
hose who can=E2=80=99t afford them. This is not an effort to dissuade voter partic=
ipation, as some people claim; instead it=E2=80=99s an effort to ensure that those=
 who vote, are legally eligible to do so. Every day, we are required to show=
 identification when we purchase age-restricted products, open a bank accoun=
t, purchase a home, stay in a hotel, acquire a fishing or hunting permit, ju=
st to name a few=E2=80=94why should we treat voting any differently? Election inte=
grity is an issue that is front and center for many of us. The fact remains=E2=
=80=94there is much work needed to keep our elections safe and secure. According=
 to a recent Gallup poll, only 19% of Americans were =E2=80=9Cvery confident=E2=80=9D th=
at votes would be accurately cast and counted ahead of the 2020 election. Th=
at number is disappointing, to say the least, and should not become the stan=
dard. Common-sense solutions to enhance election integrity, like voter ident=
ification requirements, can help to secure our elections and instill a great=
er degree of confidence in our democracy.=20

More border disorder
In a misguided effort that=E2=80=99s sure to make the bad situation on our southe=
rn border even worse, House Democrats passed two sweeping amnesty bills that=
 will put millions of illegal aliens on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship. I =
opposed both. While you may have heard that this push would only apply to a =
handful of young honor students brought here as toddlers, that=E2=80=99s not the c=
ase. Criminal aliens with gang backgrounds, multiple DUI convictions, drug v=
iolations and even firearm offenses would be eligible. In fact, one of the m=
easures is so far reaching it would even allow foreigners not currently in t=
he United States =E2=80=93 and who were deported as long as 4 years ago =E2=80=93 to obt=
ain green cards. It would also provide taxpayer funded grants to help illega=
l aliens apply for this amnesty.  Even worse, the bills do nothing to improv=
e border security or enforcement, bring the lawless border situation under c=
ontrol, or protect the livelihood of working class Americans. Rewarding ille=
gal aliens with amnesty only encourages more illegal immigration. It is also=
 terribly unfair to the millions of legal American immigrants who followed t=
he rules and came here the right way.

Dems undermine rights of women, girls=20
This week I voted against legislation that was supposed to reauthorize prot=
ections for women and girls =E2=80=93 but became mired in Washington politics. Ins=
tead of allowing a vote on a clean extension of the Violence Against Women A=
ct, the bill was complicated by the inclusion of controversial provisions on=
 race and gender, undermining what should have been an equal-opportunity fig=
ht against domestic violence and sexual abuse. The result was a bill that ex=
tends services to men who identify as women and allowing them to utilize pro=
grams specifically designed to protect and assist vulnerable women =E2=80=93 the p=
eople this law was originally designed to protect. This legislation also att=
acks our constitutionally guaranteed religious freedoms, by denying faith-ba=
sed exemptions for grant recipients, prohibiting religious organizations fro=
m running shelters and legal aid centers on the basis of their sincerely hel=
d beliefs=E2=80=94thereby forcing many of these centers for abused women to close.=
 Those victims will be left out in the street, with little to no resources. =
It seems that, like so many other things in our society today, organizations=
 offering help to those in need must also pass a progressive litmus test. Th=
is is unconscionable. Victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse deserve =
protection and should be allowed help from any organization willing to give =
it=E2=80=94not just the ones that are amenable to the radical left.

Un-constitutional Equal Rights Amendment Act=20
On Wednesday, I voted against indefinitely extending the deadline to ratify=
 the so-called =E2=80=9CEqual Rights Amendment.=E2=80=9D This is a story that begins in =
1972, when a proposed 27th amendment to the constitution was sent to the sta=
tes for ratification and given a seven-year deadline to complete the process=
. In 1978, bowing to public pressure, the Democrat-controlled Congress grant=
ed an extension until 1982=E2=80=94to try to get the 38 states needed for ratifica=
tion=E2=80=94once again moving the goalpost to try to achieve their objectives. De=
spite their departure from established precedent, the amendment did not rece=
ive the support needed. Now, almost 40 years later, they are attempting to m=
ove the goalpost once again by making the ratification process indefinite. L=
et me be clear: I support equal protection for all people under the law =E2=80=93 =
something already guaranteed by the constitution=E2=80=99s 14th amendment. But I d=
o not support circumventing the framework of our constitution to achieve par=
tisan goals. The approach we saw this week on the bill seeks to sidestep the=
 appropriate process for ratification and unconstitutionally changes deadlin=
es, retroactively. If we are to amend the United States constitution, we sho=
uld do it through the formal process and established precedent. The Constitu=
tion should guide our government in the execution of its=E2=80=99 enumerated dutie=
s. It should not, as some would prefer, be simply brushed aside in pursuit o=
f a political agenda.


                             District Update=20
COVID-19 Update=20
This week Wisconsin crossed the threshold of 2.2 million vaccines, includin=
g more than 800,000 second doses. Currently, the state is averaging 27,000+ =
doses in arms per day. Additionally, Governor Evers announced earlier this w=
eek he would be moving up the eligibility date for the next group, which inc=
ludes people with qualifying medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, an=
d obesity to this Monday March 22nd. That eligibility also now includes resi=
dents 16 and older as opposed to 18 and older. As always if you are looking =
for ways to schedule a vaccination we encourage you to reach out to your pri=
mary care doctor, local public health officer, or utilize the DHS website.=20

On a more negative note, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed earlier th=
is week the state is now reporting that 45 percent of the people who died fr=
om COVID-19 were living in long-term care facilities, a classification which=
 includes nursing homes and assisted living. For months prior the state only=
 attributed between 26 to 30 percent of COVID deaths to those long-term care=
 facilities and left most other deaths in the =E2=80=9Cunknown=E2=80=9D classification. =
This revelation marks a major shift in the ongoing conversation surrounding =
the treatment of our elderly residents throughout this pandemic. Our hope is=
 that we can continue working with state health officials to understand how =
these data discrepancies are continuing to occur.

 <br>This week, I co-authored the Securing Honesty In National Elections (SH=
INE) Act. This legislation will require everyone to provide a valid photo id=
entification to vote in federal elections and assist in providing photo IDs =
to those who can=E2=80=99t afford them. This is not an effort to dissuade voter pa=
rticipation, as some people claim; instead it=E2=80=99s an effort to ensure that t=
hose who vote, are legally eligible to do so. Every day, we are required to =
show identification when we purchase age-restricted products, open a bank ac=
count, purchase a home, stay in a hotel, acquire a fishing or hunting permit=
, just to name a few=E2=80=94why should we treat voting any differently?&nbsp;Elec=
tion integrity is an issue that is front and center for many of us. The fact=
 remains=E2=80=94there is much work needed to keep our elections safe and secure. =
According to a recent Gallup poll, only 19% of Americans were =E2=80=9Cvery confid=
ent=E2=80=9D that votes would be accurately cast and counted ahead of the 2020 ele=
ction. That number is disappointing, to say the least, and should not become=
 the standard. Common-sense solutions to enhance election integrity, like vo=
ter identification requirements, can help to secure our elections and instil=
l a greater degree of confidence in our democracy. <br><br><hr>&nbsp; &nbsp;=

/strong><strong> <br>More border disorder<br></strong>In a misguided effort =
that=E2=80=99s sure to make the bad situation on our southern border even worse, H=
ouse Democrats passed two sweeping amnesty bills that will put millions of i=
llegal aliens on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship. I opposed both.&nbsp;Whil=
e you may have heard that this push would only apply to a handful of young h=
onor students brought here as toddlers, that=E2=80=99s not the case. Criminal alie=
ns with gang backgrounds, multiple DUI convictions, drug violations and even=
 firearm offenses would be eligible. In fact, one of the measures is so far =
reaching it would even allow foreigners not currently in the United States =E2=
=80=93 and who were deported as long as 4 years ago =E2=80=93 to obtain green cards. I=
t would also provide taxpayer funded grants to help illegal aliens apply for=
 this amnesty.&nbsp; Even worse, the bills do nothing to improve border secu=
rity or enforcement, bring the lawless border situation under control, or pr=
otect the livelihood of working class Americans. Rewarding illegal aliens wi=
th amnesty only encourages more illegal immigration. It is also terribly unf=
air to the millions of legal American immigrants who followed the rules and =
came here the right way.<br><strong><br>Dems undermine rights of women, girl=
s</strong> <br>This week I voted against legislation that was supposed to re=
authorize protections for women and girls =E2=80=93 but became mired in Washington=
 politics. Instead of allowing a vote on a clean extension of the Violence A=
gainst Women Act, the bill was complicated by the inclusion of controversial=
 provisions on race and gender, undermining what should have been an equal-o=
pportunity fight against domestic violence and sexual abuse. The result was =
a bill that extends services to men who identify as women and allowing them =
to utilize programs specifically designed to protect and assist vulnerable w=
omen =E2=80=93 the people this law was originally designed to protect. This legisl=
ation also attacks our constitutionally guaranteed religious freedoms, by de=
nying faith-based exemptions for grant recipients, prohibiting religious org=
anizations from running shelters and legal aid centers on the basis of their=
 sincerely held beliefs=E2=80=94thereby forcing many of these centers for abused w=
omen to close. Those victims will be left out in the street, with little to =
no resources. It seems that, like so many other things in our society today,=
 organizations offering help to those in need must also pass a progressive l=
itmus test. This is unconscionable. Victims of domestic violence and sexual =
abuse deserve protection and should be allowed help from any organization wi=
lling to give it=E2=80=94not just the ones that are amenable to the radical left.<=
br><br><strong>Un-constitutional Equal Rights Amendment Act</strong> <br>On =
Wednesday, I voted against indefinitely extending the deadline to ratify the=
 so-called =E2=80=9CEqual Rights Amendment.=E2=80=9D This is a story that begins in 1972=
, when a proposed 27th amendment to the constitution was sent to the states =
for ratification and given a seven-year deadline to complete the process. In=
 1978, bowing to public pressure, the Democrat-controlled Congress granted a=
n extension until 1982=E2=80=94to try to get the 38 states needed for ratification=
=E2=80=94once again moving the goalpost to try to achieve their objectives. Despit=
e their departure from established precedent, the amendment did not receive =
the support needed. Now, almost 40 years later, they are attempting to move =
the goalpost once again by making the ratification process indefinite. Let m=
e be clear: I support equal protection for all people under the law =E2=80=93 some=
thing <em>already</em> guaranteed by the constitution=E2=80=99s <a style=3D"color: #=
