Dear Friend,

This week Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats continued to push a partisan a=
genda, forcing votes on a series of controversial, outside-the-mainstream le=
gislative proposals that will dig America trillions deeper into debt and tar=
get the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.

I voted against Speaker Pelosi=E2=80=99s $1.9 trillion spending bonanza last mont=
h in the House, and this week the legislation came back for final approval a=
fter clearing the Senate on a party-line vote last weekend. Just like when i=
t passed the House before, this legislation is a wish list of liberal spendi=
ng priorities and policy changes that have nothing to do with virus containm=
ent or eradication efforts (just 9 percent of the spending in the bill is ac=
tually targeted to this purpose). The bill =E2=80=93 which liberals have called th=
e =E2=80=9Cmost progressive=E2=80=9D in history =E2=80=93 would provide hundreds of billions i=
n bailout cash for irresponsible states like Illinois and reckless local gov=
ernments like San Francisco, $50 million in taxpayer funds for Title X famil=
y planning services, such as those provided by Planned Parenthood, and did n=
ot include an amendment that would have blocked stimulus checks from being s=
ent to illegal immigrants. One provision of the bill will even pay some fede=
ral employees =E2=80=93 who already enjoy six-figure compensation packages on aver=
age =E2=80=93 another $21,000 per year:  A classic example of =E2=80=9CThe Swamp=E2=80=9D taki=
ng care of its own. Finally, Democrats rejected dozens of Republican attempt=
s to include back-to-school provisions in the bill that would prioritize fun=
ding for a return to in-person classroom instruction.

Telegram readers have also seen my warnings over the last few weeks that De=
mocrats would soon take aim at our right to keep and bear arms, and this wee=
k, they did exactly that. Less than a week after rushing a flawed, anti-law =
enforcement, soft-on-crime measure through the House, Speaker Pelosi and the=
 Democrats made good on their campaign promises to enact new gun control mea=
sures, targeting the ability of law-abiding citizens to defend themselves, t=
heir businesses and their families. These bills would do nothing to stop gun=
 violence or prevent criminals from obtaining firearms, while creating new b=
arriers for sportsmen and other legal gun owners. Even worse, at the same ti=
me Democrats sought to impose new restrictions on law-abiding Americans, the=
y rejected a Republican proposal to require notification of U.S. Immigration=
 and Customs Enforcement officials when a background check indicates that an=
 illegal immigrant is attempting to purchase a firearm.

I am deeply opposed to government infringements of our constitutional right=
s and voted against these dangerous and unconstitutional bills.

Border disorder=20
The dangerous immigration policies President Biden has put in place are alr=
eady fueling a humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern bor=
der. From his ill-advised effort to suspend all deportations and promises of=
 amnesty for illegal aliens, to his decisions to halt construction of the bo=
rder fence and a return to the failed =E2=80=9Ccatch and release=E2=80=9D policies of th=
e past, the White House is creating a lawless and chaotic environment that p=
uts all of us at risk. According to statistics released by Customs and Borde=
r Protection (CBP) officials, President Biden=E2=80=99s first full month in office=
 has resulted in record illegal immigration numbers. Nearly 10,000 unaccompa=
nied juveniles were nabbed at the southwest border in February, and CBP said=
 it recorded more than 100,000 =E2=80=9Cencounters=E2=80=9D with illegal immigrants. Yet=
 as large as those numbers are =E2=80=93 they do not reflect the potentially thous=
ands more who evaded detection. Drug seizures at the southern border are als=
o running well ahead of last year, and recent intelligence assessments sugge=
st that the =E2=80=9Cincentives=E2=80=9D the Biden administration=E2=80=99s policy changes hav=
e created are encouraging drug cartels and human traffickers to ramp up thei=
r efforts, and could lead to a =E2=80=9Csignificant influx=E2=80=9D of migrants from pla=
ces as far away as Asia and the Middle East, with some individuals paying sm=
ugglers $20,000 or more to get into the U.S. illegally. The chaos is getting=
 worse with each passing day, which is why I joined several of my colleagues=
 in asking the administration to explain how they plan to respond to this cr=
isis, and restore order on the border. =20

I joined my GOP colleagues this week to discuss the crisis at our border.=20

Did Facebook steal the election in Green Bay?=20
That=E2=80=99s a question a lot of people are asking in response to a bombshell s=
tory raising fresh new questions about the way a few jurisdictions in our st=
ate conducted the elections last year. For those of you who haven=E2=80=99t heard,=
 state lawmakers are investigating credible reports that a private advocacy =
group led by a political operative =E2=80=93 and financed by Facebook boss Mark Zu=
ckerberg =E2=80=93 was allowed to take an active role in running the election in G=
reen Bay. The report notes that the operative was given keys to the main loc=
ation where ballots were counted, and created such a =E2=80=9Chostile work environ=
ment=E2=80=9D that both the local Clerk and Deputy Clerk resigned. Telegram Reader=
s know that we are deeply concerned about the integrity of our elections, an=
d troubled by legislation (H.R. 1) Speaker Pelosi muscled through the House =
last month that would expand so-called =E2=80=9Cballot harvesting,=E2=80=9D undermine st=
ate voter ID laws, and even pour public money into the campaign accounts of =
wealthy politicians, ad consultants and well-heeled political operatives. I =
hope state officials will get to the bottom of what happened in Green Bay, a=
nd that lawmakers can work together to defeat H.R. 1 and prevent this kind o=

                        Committee Update
Natural Resources Committee=20
This week the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resource=
s had a hearing on energy development laws. Unfortunately, the Democrats wan=
t to double-down on the actions of President Biden and make it increasingly =
difficult to produce energy in America. As if shutting down the Keystone XL =
pipeline weren=E2=80=99t bad enough, Democrats on the committee now want to add mo=
re burdensome and expensive new regulations to energy development in an effo=
rt to end all oil and gas production on our public lands. One of the bills d=
iscussed in this hearing, H.R. 1506, would implement standards created by th=
e so-called =E2=80=9CSustainability Accounting Standards Board=E2=80=9D (SASB). The SASB=
 is a private organization funded by some notable donors, Michael Bloomberg =
and Tom Steyer. If supporters of this bill get their way, the federal govern=
ment would be outsourcing energy regulations to a private panel founded and =
funded by left-wing, billionaires. I think that=E2=80=99s a bad idea and will cont=
inue to fight to ensure that our families and small businesses have access t=
o abundant, affordable, American energy that protects job security, economic=
 security and national security.=20

                          Recent Legislation=20
This week, I cosponsored a bill with my colleague Rep. Sam Graves of Missou=
ri to ensure the continuation of 6-day mail service. Over the years we have =
seen proposals to eliminate Saturday mail delivery, which would place an und=
ue hardship on rural communities. Eliminating a day of mail and package deli=
very, especially at a time when so many of us are increasingly depending on =
the Postal Services for everything from prescription medications and food, t=
ime-sensitive business and legal documents, just doesn=E2=80=99t make sense. Since=
 1912, the tradition of reliable service six days a week has been a hallmark=
 of the Postal Service that millions of Americans pay for and rely on.

Reopen Schools Act=20
This week, we continued to see news throughout the country highlighting how=
 the CDC misinterpreted data on safe school reopenings and forced children t=
o remain in hybrid or virtual learning environments. One article which caugh=
t my attention in USA Today used the CDC study conducted in Wisconsin school=
 districts as a primary example for how school reopening can be conducted sa=
fely and with limited chance of transmission. The science is there. Children=
 have a significantly lower risk of contracting this virus compared to elder=
ly adults, and an even lower probability of ever experiencing any serious si=
de effects. The CDC study in Wood County showed a transmission rate of 0.09 =
percent in classroom settings, a rate far lower than transmissions of the fl=
u in a normal school year. Most importantly, this article refers to this per=
iod of early childhood learning as =E2=80=9Ca psychological pandemic,=E2=80=9D a stark r=
eality that too many Democrats are willing to ignore. Anxiety, depression, u=
nstable homes, and food insecurity are all occurring while our Democratic le=
aders sit idly by willing to let virtual learning ruin the future for Americ=
a=E2=80=99s youth.

Pipelines are lifelines=20
This week I signed a letter to President Biden that highlights the grave co=
nsequences that our state and region would face if the Enbridge Line 5 pipel=
ine was shut down. As we=E2=80=99ve seen with the Keystone XL pipeline, this admin=
istration has already proven its capacity to shut down domestic energy pipel=
ines, so it is essential that Line 5 does not suffer the same fate. The impa=
ct of another pipeline cancellation would be enormous, killing thousands of =
jobs -- including many right here in our state, as well as billions of dolla=
rs in economic output. Even worse, it would make energy in the Midwest more =
difficult to transport, and more expensive. Pipelines are the safest and mos=
t efficient mechanism to transport energy products, so getting rid of Line 5=
 would just force this oil and natural gas to be transported by trucks or ra=
il. I am dedicated to protecting Wisconsin jobs and ensuring we continue to =
have affordable access to energy. You can read this letter here.=20
                            District Update=20
This week marked more exciting milestones in the battle against COVID and t=
he vaccination process. Statewide, our vaccine administrators have administe=
red more than 1.8 million first doses, with another 200,000 in transit this =
week. Wisconsin is currently number one in the country for vaccine distribut=
ion efficiency i.e. speed of receiving vaccines and getting them in arms. Ea=
rlier this week, Department of Health Services announced there will no longe=
r be a waitlist for anyone in a long-term care facility setting or anyone on=
 Medicaid, marking another positive milestone in vaccinating our state=E2=80=99s m=
ost vulnerable residents. Additionally, this week marked the beginning of va=
ccinations for educators, many of whom received the first doses of Johnson &=
 Johnson coming out of distribution. This is another critical step towards g=
etting kids back in school full-time in every part of the state.


                             Recent Votes=20
H.R. 8 - No Background Checks for Criminals Act=20
This week I voted =E2=80=9CNO=E2=80=9D on this violation of our rights. The Democrats, =
completely ignoring the facts and statistics, continue their all-out assault=
 of our constitutionally protected right to bear arms. All one has to do is =
canvas the states who have the strictest gun laws, to know this approach at =
ending crime and violence is misguided and unconstitutional. This bill purpo=
rts to institute a =E2=80=9Cuniversal=E2=80=9D background check for firearms purchase an=
d transfers =E2=80=93 but nothing could be further from the truth, since universal=
 means everyone. Of course, most criminals steal the weapons they use or get=
 them through illegal channels, so they don=E2=80=99t undergo background checks. T=
he Department of Justice announced that 75 percent of criminals in state and=
 federal prison who possessed a weapon, acquired that weapon through theft o=
r so-called =E2=80=9Cblack markets.=E2=80=9D Less than 1 percent of those criminals got =
firearms from gun shows. This legislation ignores these basic facts and inst=
ead subjects all law-abiding, responsible gun owners to more red tape and bu=
reaucracy. The legislation creates ambiguity for transfers between spouses, =
family members and victims of domestic violence =E2=80=93 shifting the burden of p=
roof from the government to the individual =E2=80=93 and could make sportsmen liab=
le for loaning a hunting weapon to a friend. We should be focusing on common=
-sense bipartisan legislation to support law enforcement and put criminals b=
ehind bars where they belong, not taking pot-shots at our constitution and p=
utting a target on the backs of legal gun owners.=20

H.R. 1446, Democrat Background Check Delay Act=20
Similarly, I voted =E2=80=9CNO=E2=80=9D on this =E2=80=9Cpower-grab=E2=80=9D legislation aimed at d=
issuading gun-ownership. Not only does this enable the creation of a firearm=
s registry, it grants unelected government bureaucrats broad discretion to s=
ignificantly delay firearm purchases. It eliminates the current =E2=80=9C3-day saf=
ety-valve,=E2=80=9D which prevents the government from instituting an indefinite d=
elay on firearm purchases for law-abiding Americans. It addresses the non-ex=
istent =E2=80=9Cgun show=E2=80=9D loophole the Democrats insist exists =E2=80=93 despite feder=
al law requiring firearm dealers to be licensed, and to initiate a National =
Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) check, before transferring a=
 firearm to a non-dealer regardless of where the transfer takes place. For o=
ur readers who may not know, under our current system when the 3-day safety =
valve window has passed, the FBI continues to research the matter that gave =
rise to an individual=E2=80=99s delay=E2=80=94for 90 days after the check was initiated.=
 If it is later determined that the person is prohibited from possessing fir=
earms, the ATF is notified and tasked with retrieving the firearm. The curre=
nt three-day safety-valve provision is vital and protects gun owners in nume=
rous ways. The safety-valve provision ensures that if there is a disruption =
to NICS or an overwhelming volume of background checks, lawful firearm trans=
fers from dealers can still take place. Most importantly, the safety-valve p=
rovision ensures that the FBI carries out its background check duties in an =

=9D on this violation of our rights. The Democrats, completely ignoring the fa=
cts and statistics, continue their all-out assault of our constitutionally p=
rotected right to bear arms. All one has to do is canvas the states who have=
 the strictest gun laws, to know this approach at ending crime and violence =
is misguided and unconstitutional. This bill purports to institute a =E2=80=9Cuniv=
ersal=E2=80=9D background check for firearms purchase and transfers =E2=80=93 but nothin=
g could be further from the truth, since universal means everyone. Of course=
, most criminals steal the weapons they use or get them through illegal chan=
nels, so they don=E2=80=99t undergo background checks. The Department of Justice a=
nnounced that 75 percent of criminals in state and federal prison who posses=
sed a weapon, acquired that weapon through theft or so-called =E2=80=9Cblack marke=
ts.=E2=80=9D Less than 1 percent of those criminals got firearms from gun shows. T=
his legislation ignores these basic facts and instead subjects all law-abidi=
ng, responsible gun owners to more red tape and bureaucracy. The legislation=
 creates ambiguity for transfers between spouses, family members and victims=
 of domestic violence =E2=80=93 shifting the burden of proof from the government t=
o the individual =E2=80=93 and could make sportsmen liable for loaning a hunting w=
eapon to a friend. We should be focusing on common-sense bipartisan legislat=
ion to support law enforcement and put criminals behind bars where they belo=
ng, not taking pot-shots at our constitution and putting a target on the bac=
ks of legal gun owners. <br><br><strong>H.R. 1446, Democrat Background Check=
 Delay Act</strong> <br>Similarly, I voted =E2=80=9CNO=E2=80=9D on this =E2=80=9Cpower-grab=E2=80=9D=
 legislation aimed at dissuading gun-ownership. Not only does this enable th=
e creation of a firearms registry, it grants unelected government bureaucrat=
s broad discretion to significantly delay firearm purchases. It eliminates t=
he current =E2=80=9C3-day safety-valve,=E2=80=9D which prevents the government from inst=
ituting an indefinite delay on firearm purchases for law-abiding Americans. =
It addresses the non-existent =E2=80=9Cgun show=E2=80=9D loophole the Democrats insist e=
xists =E2=80=93 despite federal law requiring firearm dealers to be licensed, and =
to initiate a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) check=
, before transferring a firearm to a non-dealer regardless of where the tran=
sfer takes place. For our readers who may not know, under our current system=
 when the 3-day safety valve window has passed, the FBI continues to researc=
h the matter that gave rise to an individual=E2=80=99s delay=E2=80=94for 90 days after t=
he check was initiated. If it is later determined that the person is prohibi=
ted from possessing firearms, the ATF is notified and tasked with retrieving=
 the firearm. The current three-day safety-valve provision is vital and prot=
ects gun owners in numerous ways. The safety-valve provision ensures that if=
 there is a disruption to NICS or an overwhelming volume of background check=
s, lawful firearm transfers from dealers can still take place. Most importan=
tly, the safety-valve provision ensures that the FBI carries out its backgro=
und check duties in an expedient and responsible manner that recognizes and =
respects the constitution=E2=80=99s individual right to keep and bear arms. Absent=
 this provision, the FBI will have less incentive to conduct NICS checks in =
