Dear Friends,We=E2=80=99ve been through a lot as a nation in these early days of =
2021. I would like to thank you for the support and kind words I have receiv=
ed since the insurrection on our Capitol. I am working hard to hold those wh=
o incited, enabled, and participated accountable for their actions.Despite t=
he challenges and awful events in Washington, we must continue to focus on t=
he COVID relief our country desperately needs. I=E2=80=99ve heard many questions a=
nd concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in New Jersey, the n=
ext round of PPP loans, EIDL and EIP stimulus checks. You can find details o=
n federal programs and vaccine distribution below.I=E2=80=99ll continue to send up=
dates in newsletters and on my social media pages as more information is ava=
ilable. And finally, I would like to congratulate the local elected official=
s who were recently sworn in throughout the district. A bright spot for me d=
uring this difficult past year has been seeing how local officials have part=
nered together to support our residents. I look forward to working with all =
of you and supporting the work you undertake on behalf of your towns and you=
r constituents.  Best wishes and I hope that you and your loved ones stay sa=
fe and healthy,
Mikie Sherrill

SMALL BUSINESS: PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM
Meeting with small business owners across the district during COVID, it is =
clear that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) established by the CARES Ac=
t last March has been a lifeline during this crisis. In fact, $530 million i=
n PPP loans under $150,000 came to NJ-11 in 2020.=20

But it was also extremely clear that small businesses needed more relief. I=
 was proud to vote for the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonpro=
fits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) as part of the Coronavirus Response =
and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 that passed in December. =
This legislation reopened the PPP through March 31, 2021, with $284.45 billi=
on in funding.

The PPP is reopening in stages. On Friday, January 15 it opened to lenders =
with less than $1 billion in assets. And it opens to ALL lenders on Tuesday,=
 January 19. Similar to the first round of the PPP, small businesses and non=
profits should apply for the loans through a private lender. Large banks, co=
mmunity banks, and FinTech lenders are all taking applications.=20

First Draw and Second Draw loans are available for eligible small businesse=
s and nonprofits.=20
You may be eligible for a First Draw loan if you did not receive a PPP loan=
 prior to August 8, 2020.=20

You may be eligible for a Second Draw loan if you already received and spen=
t your First Draw, have 300 employees or less, and can demonstrate a 25% los=
s in revenue between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020.

Other highlights of the legislation with respect to PPP include a simplifie=
d 1-page loan forgiveness certification for those who received a loan of $15=
0,000 or less and expanded use of PPP funds to include new expenses like PPE=
 and some operational expenses. With respect to the tax treatment of PPP Loa=
ns, this provision clarified that gross income does not include any amount t=
hat would otherwise arise from the forgiveness of a PPP loan.

For more information and updates you can visit SBA.gov/PPP or Treasury.gov/=
CARES, or go to the resources below:

onomic Aid Act or here for a section by section summary of the legislation.=20

SMALL BUSINESS: ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER LOANS=20

Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) have been another key part of the sma=
ll business relief throughout COVID, with an excess of $600 million in loans=
 coming to NJ-11 in 2020. The SBA has announced that as a result of the COVI=
D relief legislation signed at the end of December it was extending the appl=
ication deadline for the EIDL program to December 31, 2021.

The Economic Aid Act also made clarifications about the treatment of EIDL A=
dvance Amounts with respect to the deduction from loan forgiveness (includin=
g retroactively) and exclusion from gross income for tax purposes.=20

The EIDL Advance program is currently closed but was provided with an addit=
ional $20 billion through this legislation targeted to certain businesses. W=
e will keep you updated when we have more information on reopening and eligi=
bility requirements. =20

Click here for more information on the SBA=E2=80=99s announcement of the extended=
 EIDL deadline.

duction and taxation clarifications for EIDL Advance Amounts in the Economic=
 Aid Act or here for a section by section summary of the legislation.

 ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS

The December COVID-19 relief package we passed also included Economic Impac=
t Payments (EIPs) of $600 for eligible individuals and $1,200 for eligible m=
arried couples. You can determine your eligibility and payment status on the=
 IRS website by clicking here. These payments are being distributed by the D=
epartment of the Treasury throughout the month of January.

According to a briefing my team received this week from the House Ways and =
Means Committee, 147 million EIPs have already been distributed or are sched=
uled to be distributed. The vast majority of payments have been made electro=
nically through direct deposit payments (when the IRS has your bank account =
information). Payments are also being made by paper checks and debit cards c=
alled EIP Cards.=20

For those of you who are EIP Card recipients, I want to make you aware that=
:

EIP Cards will be mailed in a plain white envelope which prominently displa=
ys the U.S. Treasury seal and =E2=80=9CEconomic Impact Payment Card=E2=80=9D in the retu=
rn address. The envelope also states that it contains =E2=80=9Cimportant informati=
on about their Economic Impact Payment.=E2=80=9D (See photo below.)  Source: U.S. =
Treasury Department

If you have accidentally thrown away an EIP Card, you can call customer ser=
vice at 1-800-240-8100 to report it and request a free replacement.=20

If you do not receive your payment electronically or in the mail, the IRS h=
as advised that you must claim it on your 2020 tax return as a Recovery Reba=
te Credit. Additional resources on EIPs can be found below:

CORONAVIRUS VACCINES=20

While the coronavirus relief funding described above is critical to our com=
munity surviving this pandemic, we all know that a successful vaccine progra=
m is the key to getting to the other side of this crisis. This vaccination e=
ffort requires incredible collaboration between all levels of government, as=
 well as our healthcare providers as I saw firsthand as I visited three vacc=
ination sites around NJ-11 over the past few weeks. Morristown Medical for t=
he first day of vaccines for our frontline healthcare workers in December, a=
t the Morris County Regional Vaccination Center in Rockaway as it opened for=
 vaccinations of first responders, and the Essex County site in West Orange =
last week.=20


Top, L to R: Rep. Sherrill went to Morristown Medical Center on December 15=
 as they vaccinated some of the first frontline healthcare workers; Rep. She=
rrill visited the Kmart vaccination site in West Orange on January 11, with =
Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo and Sheriff Armando B. Fontoura.=20
Bottom: Rep. Sherrill visited the Rockaway mega site opening with Governor =
Murphy on January 8.
As you may know, New Jersey is administering vaccines to residents in phase=
s. Currently (as of 1/16/21), only those in Phases 1A and 1B are eligible fo=
r vaccines in New Jersey. You can find more detail on who is included in the=
se phases at the New Jersey state website here. State and County portals whe=
re you can register for the vaccine are listed below, which will notify you =
when you are eligible for an appointment.=20

This process will require patience as the number of appointments for vaccin=
ations can be limited by factors like the number of vaccine doses received e=
ach week by the state of New Jersey and the number of frontline workers avai=
lable to administer shots. My team and I have been in touch with officials a=
t Operation Warpspeed to understand what is being done to optimize the numbe=
r of doses coming to New Jersey. And I was pleased to see that President-ele=
ct Biden=E2=80=99s relief plan proposed last week would provide essential funding =
for our country=E2=80=99s vaccination campaign.=20

Registration portals and other resources from the state of New Jersey and t=
he counties about vaccines can be found below. You should also monitor infor=
mation from your healthcare provider as appropriate to determine their capac=
ity for vaccine appointments and sign up processes. =20

 across the district during COVID, it is clear that the Paycheck Protection =
Program (PPP) established by the CARES Act last March has been a lifeline du=
ring this crisis. In fact, $530 million in PPP loans under $150,000 came to =
NJ-11 in 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>But it was also extremely clear that small busin=
esses needed more relief. I was proud to vote for the Economic Aid to Hard-H=
it Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) as part o=
f the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 202=
1 that passed in December.&nbsp;<strong>This legislation reopened the PPP th=
rough March 31, 2021, with $284.45 billion in funding.</strong><br><br>The P=
PP is reopening in stages. On&nbsp;<strong>Friday, January 15</strong>&nbsp;=
it opened to lenders with less than $1 billion in assets. And it opens to AL=
L lenders on&nbsp;<strong>Tuesday, January 19</strong>. Similar to the first=
 round of the PPP, small businesses and nonprofits should apply for the loan=
s through a private lender. Large banks, community banks, and FinTech lender=
s are all taking applications.&nbsp;<br><br>First Draw and Second Draw loans=
 are available for eligible small businesses and nonprofits.&nbsp;</span></d=
