Dear John,
The U.S. has been able to withstand trying times before. The saving grace h=
as always been the determination of the American people and the checks and b=
alances written into the Constitution. Over the past several months, we have=
 seen the checks and balances  in action, as the courts have provided a chec=
k on the president time and again.=20

What=E2=80=99s troubling now is the shift in the makeup of the courts; most signi=
ficantly, the shift in the highest court of all. In my view, the president i=
s loading the Supreme Court up with far-right conservatives who are hostile =
toward landmark decisions, like Roe  v. Wade.

First, the president was able to push through the confirmation of Justice G=
orsuch. Now, the president has nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh. After learni=
ng more about his record, I believe it should give even far-right conservati=
ves pause.=20

His record on women=E2=80=99s reproductive health care and health care in general=
 would arguably deliver the biggest blow yet to all of us who fought for the=
 Affordable Care Act. If appointed, he could be the deciding vote on rolling=
 back protections for Americans  with pre-existing conditions.=20

As a member of Congress who has advocated for stricter privacy, I am alarme=
d by what I would describe as a complete disregard for the Fourth Amendment =
and privacy. He sided with the government, allowing for the collection of in=
formation about who you call  without a warrant - and his history of anti-pr=
ivacy opinions doesn=E2=80=99t end there.=20

Further, I=E2=80=99m also alarmed by his views on presidential power and his beli=
ef that the president should be immune from criminal investigations. Now mor=
e than ever, it=E2=80=99s critical that the Supreme Court serve as a check on the =
presidency and ensure our nation=E2=80=99s  laws are applied fairly and without ex=
ception. =20

Like with Gorsuch, I expect Kavanaugh would fall in line with a Trump agend=
a.=20

Although the nomination process only goes through the Senate, I=E2=80=99ll contin=
ue to be vocal in my opposition to Brett Kavanaugh. The courts shouldn=E2=80=99t b=
e a political arm of the president; they should be independent, full of inte=
grity, and objective. 1
