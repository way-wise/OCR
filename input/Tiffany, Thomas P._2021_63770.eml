Dear Friend,

We wanted to start off this week by reminding everyone that Mother=E2=80=99s Day =
is right around the corner. So if you haven=E2=80=99t already =E2=80=93 make sure you ge=
t out there and pick up something nice for Mom.

Speaking of Mother=E2=80=99s Day, you=E2=80=99d think motherhood would be one of the fe=
w things everybody in Washington could get behind =E2=80=93 right up there with ap=
ple pie. But like so many things in the nation=E2=80=99s capital these days, nothi=
ng seems beyond the reach of woke political correctness.

As you may have seen, one of my colleagues evidently thinks the term =E2=80=9Cmot=
her=E2=80=9D itself is outdated. In a tweet this week, she used the term =E2=80=9Cbirthi=
ng people=E2=80=9D as a substitute.  I=E2=80=99m not kidding, and this is not a late Apr=
il Fools=E2=80=99 joke. You can read about it here.

This week unemployment claims fell to their lowest point since the pandemic=
 outbreak began more than a year ago in Communist China. But there is more t=
o the story. Jobless claims are still well above where they were when the ec=
onomy was humming pre-COVID.  Even worse, nearly 4 million fewer people are =
in the labor force than there were back then =E2=80=93 and that has a lot to do wi=
th the tidal wave of runaway spending in Washington.

Restaurant and tavern owners =E2=80=93 some of those hardest hit by job-killing g=
overnment lockdowns over the last year =E2=80=93 are seeing customers come through=
 their doors again. That=E2=80=99s the good news.  The bad news is that many can=E2=80=
=99t hire enough workers to meet the resurgent demand.  And it=E2=80=99s not because=
 we have a shortage of workers.  It is because government is literally payin=
g people not to work. The bottom line is that thanks to generous unemploymen=
t benefits being shelled out by the Biden administration, some Americans are=
 in no hurry to go back to work.

Many of you know exactly what I=E2=80=99m talking about, and this unfortunately i=
sn=E2=80=99t a new phenomenon. People choosing not to work are receiving an additi=
onal $300 a week federal unemployment =E2=80=9Cbonus=E2=80=9D on top of regular state be=
nefits, which average $318 a week. And when you consider that staying on tho=
se benefits often pays more than working full-time at $15 an hour, it isn=E2=80=99=
t a big surprise. Simply put, when government subsidizes something, you get =
more of it =E2=80=93 and in this case, your tax dollars are being spent in a way t=
hat keeps people out of the workforce.

With the worst of the pandemic behind us thanks to a resilient economy buil=
t on pro-growth tax policies, regulatory reforms and speedy vaccine developm=
ent, it=E2=80=99s now time for state and federal leaders to remove financial disin=
centives to work =E2=80=93 not create new ones. =20

In the meantime, if you=E2=80=99re semi-retired or have some extra time on your h=
ands, now is a great time to make some extra money (and help out your local =
small business) by seeing if you can pick up an extra shift or two.

We hope you have a great weekend, and that you enjoy this week=E2=80=99s edition =
of the Telegram!

Sincerely,


=20

Race-based restaurant assistance on the menu?=20
For months, left-wing activists have tried to inject the issue of race into=
 every aspect of our lives. From large corporations telling employees to =E2=80=9C=
be less white=E2=80=9D and school administrators admitting that their goal is to m=
ake certain children feel =E2=80=9Cless than=E2=80=9D because of their race, to segregat=
ed college graduation ceremonies and even proposals to dole out medical care=
 based on the color of a patient=E2=80=99s skin, things seem to get more absurd wi=
th each passing day. Now the Biden administration appears to have put race o=
n the menu again -- this time when it comes to assistance for pandemic-stric=
ken bars and restaurants. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is set to =
distribute billions in assistance to struggling eateries =E2=80=93 but there=E2=80=99s a=
 catch. Some businesses may get a leg-up based on skin color.  This is simpl=
y wrong. The pandemic clobbered restaurants and taverns across the country i=
n a color-blind way, and the job-killing, government-imposed lockdowns that =
followed inflicted a devastating, =E2=80=9Cequal-opportunity=E2=80=9D one-two punch on m=
om-and-pop businesses. So why is the Biden administration now picking winner=
s and losers based on arbitrary characteristics like race? It was wrong for =
the Biden administration to practice this kind of racial discrimination agai=
nst farmers through the USDA, and it is just as wrong for the Biden SBA to d=
iscriminate against those in the hospitality sector. Government-sponsored ra=
cial discrimination is immoral, it is unfair, it is unconstitutional, and it=
 must stop.

Are American sports stars profiting from Chinese slave labor?=20
That=E2=80=99s a question many Americans are beginning to ask. Chinese sports app=
arel companies with ties to the communist regime have openly bragged that th=
eir supply chains are linked to a cotton-producing region in western China c=
alled Xinjiang, where the Chinese government is operating concentration camp=
s, forcibly sterilizing and torturing religious and political dissidents whi=
le committing genocide.  At least two of those Chinese companies, Li-Ning an=
d Anta, have entered into multi-million dollar endorsement deals with curren=
t and retired American NBA stars.  I have cosponsored bipartisan legislation=
 in the past to block imports from Xinjiang, but we must do more. Lawmakers =
on both sides of the political aisle must continue to work together to hold =
China accountable and ensure that no American is inadvertently financing Bei=
jing=E2=80=99s human rights abuses by purchasing tainted products =E2=80=93 or actively =
pocketing the profits of modern-day slavery. More on that later.

=E2=80=9CStimulating=E2=80=9D foreign economies?=20
Some of you may recall reports from last year about $1,200 stimulus checks =
being erroneously deposited into the bank accounts of foreign nationals =E2=80=93 =
who happily spent that money in their home countries.  We all know that this=
 sort of thing is bound to happen when government rushes to spend billions =E2=
=80=93 or these days even trillions =E2=80=93 of dollars with little discussion, debat=
e or oversight.  After those reports, the Treasury Department said they woul=
d =E2=80=9Cexplor[e] possible options=E2=80=9D to ensure that this didn=E2=80=99t happen again=
. But it did. Thanks to some of you, we=E2=80=99ve been made aware of a few instan=
ces of foreign workers who headed home long before President Biden signed hi=
s $1.9 trillion spending package into law receiving $1,400 stimulus checks =E2=
=80=93 money that was supposed to =E2=80=9Cstimulate=E2=80=9D the American economy =E2=80=93 not s=
ent abroad. I am looking into what can be done to track down this money and =
will continue to support measures that restrict eligibility for taxpayer-fun=
ded assistance programs solely to U.S. citizens.=20

                          Committee Update
House Judiciary Committee=20
Protecting American intellectual property=20
This week, we learned that the Biden administration supports waiving patent=
 protections for COVID vaccines. That=E2=80=99s why I joined several of my colleag=
ues in penning a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, Katherine Tai, urg=
ing her to oppose the request to waive certain portions of the Agreement on =
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all member=
s of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This comes as India and South Afric=
a are both requesting a patent waiver to get all the intellectual property f=
rom the vaccine companies already producing the vaccine, so they can start t=
heirs. And it isn=E2=80=99t just India and South Africa that could benefit.  The W=
all Street Journal recently pointed out that this could also =E2=80=93 ironically =
=E2=80=93 benefit Communist China. =E2=80=9CChina=E2=80=99s current crop of vaccines are far l=
ess effective than those in the West, but soon Beijing might be able to purv=
ey Pfizer knock-offs,=E2=80=9D the paper noted. =E2=80=9CThe U.S. has spent years deplor=
ing China=E2=80=99s theft of American IP, and now the Biden Administration may vol=
untarily let China reap profits from decades of American innovation.=E2=80=9D The =
truth is that many vaccine companies are already helping foreign countries w=
ith vaccine development. That is a tremendous display of American goodwill t=
o the rest of the world. Instead of undermining American technological prowe=
ss, the White House should advocate for strong intellectual property protect=
ions to help keep American businesses strong and vibrant. America invests hu=
ge sums of money in research and development to keep a steady stream of cutt=
ing-edge products coming to market. That=E2=80=99s why I signed on to the Preventi=
ng Foreign Attempts to Erode Healthcare Innovation Act sponsored by Rep. Byr=
on Donalds of Florida. The bill would defund any attempt by the Biden Admini=
stration to support the WTO TRIPS waiver.

House Committee on Natural Resources
=E2=80=9CGreen energy,=E2=80=9D emissions and human rights=20
This Wednesday the Natural Resources Committee had a markup for a number of=
 partisan bills that would increase burdensome regulations, kill jobs, and w=
eaken American energy independence. That said, I offered two amendments to t=
ry and make a bad bill a little bit better.  One of these bills, H.R. 1506, =
would implement standards and disclosure requirements created by the so-call=
ed =E2=80=9CSustainability Accounting Standards Board=E2=80=9D (SASB), a non-governmenta=
l entity funded by some notable donors like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer=
. My first amendment sought to level the playing field by applying the same =
emissions disclosure mandates to so-called =E2=80=9Cgreen energy=E2=80=9D companies that=
 the bill would apply to traditional energy producers (too often, =E2=80=9Cgreen e=
nergy=E2=80=9D companies that claim to be =E2=80=9Clow emission=E2=80=9D don=E2=80=99t include the e=
missions created by their efforts to obtain compounds and construct solar pa=
nels and wind turbines in their calculations). I also put forward a second a=
mendment that would require companies to disclose whether any of the materia=
ls or labor sourced in the construction of solar panels and wind turbines co=
me from the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China that we mentioned earlier in=
 the newsletter. We know that between one-third and one-half of the polysili=
con material used to make the world=E2=80=99s solar panels comes from Xinjiang, an=
d that =E2=80=9CXinjiang Goldwind=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 one of China=E2=80=99s largest wind turbine man=
ufacturers =E2=80=93 has deep links to the Chinese Communist Party. This amendment=
 will help ensure that the American people know if so-called =E2=80=9Cclean energy=
=E2=80=9D developers are exploiting =E2=80=9Cdirty=E2=80=9D practices like slave labor =E2=80=93 or =
are complicit in China=E2=80=99s shocking human rights abuses. Both of my amendmen=
ts were adopted by a voice vote.=20

                          Recent Legislation
Demanding answers on Postal Service spying
Recent news reports recently revealed that the United States Postal Service=
 was not only delivering mail, but also acting as a de facto investigative a=
gency, parsing through private social media posts of domestic and foreign ci=
tizens. Concerning news, to say the least, as their function should be to de=
liver the mail rather than spy on Americans. Interestingly, this surveillanc=
e started in December of 2020 =E2=80=93 not during the summer riots =E2=80=93 and allege=
dly tracked and collected information on Americans=E2=80=99 social media posts, in=
cluding those involving protests. The program, named Internet Covert Operati=
ons Program (iCOP) had not been made public until now, and purportedly searc=
hed for =E2=80=9Cinflammatory=E2=80=9D postings to share with other law enforcement agen=
cies. The U.S. Constitution protects citizens from unlawful government surve=
illance without a warrant. In light of this very troubling report, I joined =
several of my colleagues in requesting an immediate briefing from the Postma=
ster General. Unfortunately, this isn=E2=80=99t the first time we=E2=80=99ve seen the fe=
deral government weaponize a federal agency in pursuit for what appears to b=
e political or ideological reasons. Many Telegram readers no doubt remember =
how Lois Lerner and the IRS illegally targeted conservative groups during th=
e Obama -Biden administration. I will continue to keep a close eye on this, =
to ensure that organs of government are not being deployed against Americans=
 for partisan purposes. =20

ers are down an additional 26 percent. I would also like to note that after =
a number of concerning weeks with variant cases spreading throughout Michiga=
n and Minnesota, both states are now seeing a downward trajectory of 48 perc=
ent and 19 percent respectively.=20

On the vaccine front, Wisconsin has distributed 4.4 million vaccine doses, =
1.8 million being second doses. Currently 43.7 percent of Wisconsinites have=
 received at least one dose. Additionally, this week the White House announc=
ed a new goal=E2=80=94to have at least 70 percent of adults in the U.S. receive th=
eir first dose by July 4th, putting us well within reach of herd immunity. A=
s always, if you are interested in receiving a vaccine please utilize your l=
ocal pharmacy participating in the federal pharmacy program or register for =
the statewide appointment system here: https://vaccinate.wi.gov/en-US/.
