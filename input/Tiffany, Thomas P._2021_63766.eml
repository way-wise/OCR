Dear Friend,

Democrats continued their push to impose far reaching gun control bills thi=
s week after a man reportedly gunned down several people in a Boulder, Color=
ado grocery store. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, several high-pr=
ofile progressives made false and inflammatory claims about the alleged assa=
ilant=E2=80=99s background and sought to politicize the tragedy. Former President =
Obama and his wife described those of us standing up for the Second Amendmen=
t as =E2=80=9Ccowardly,=E2=80=9D and President Biden demanded a ban on semi-automatic ri=
fles. What they didn=E2=80=99t tell you is that many of the gun control measures s=
ome Democrats in Washington, DC are demanding =E2=80=93 including so-called =E2=80=9Cuni=
versal=E2=80=9D background checks, =E2=80=9Cred flag=E2=80=9D laws, a ban on so-called =E2=80=9Chigh=
 capacity magazines=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cassault weapons=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93 are already on the book=
s in the community where this shooting occurred, and they did absolutely not=
hing to prevent it.

Many of you have reached out asking about the Second Amendment power grab t=
hat Democrats are attempting here in Washington.

I wanted to take a moment to explain the bills that are being pushed throug=
h the House, how they will affect you, and what the Democrats are planning n=
ext.

Watch here.
Unfortunately, the purveyors of these gun-grabs are determined to move forw=
ard with their efforts to target the rights of law-abiding citizens =E2=80=93 and =
will go to great lengths to do so, even if it means getting rid of the Senat=
e filibuster to do it.

On the fiscal front, the ink is barely dry on the massive, $1.9 trillion pa=
rtisan spending bonanza President Biden recently signed into law =E2=80=93 yet som=
e in Congress are already talking about passing another, even larger spendin=
g package with an eye-popping price tag of $3.1 trillion. Even worse, with m=
any small businesses still suffocating under government-mandated lockdowns, =
millions of Americans unemployed, and gas prices soaring, the White House is=
 also considering a gigantic tax hike totaling more than $2 trillion =E2=80=93 one=
 that would hit every American in the pocketbook.  But there may be one nota=
ble exception: Ultra wealthy Americans in high-tax states like New York, Cal=
ifornia and Illinois, who would stand to benefit from a special tax giveaway=
 financed by working-class Americans who live in low-tax states. This specia=
l interest handout was trimmed by President Trump=E2=80=99s tax reform bill a few =
years ago, but President Biden is now quietly seeking to expand it. You can =
read more about that effort here.

In more encouraging news, we heard from a very unlikely ally this week in t=
he fight against Big Tech=E2=80=99s online censorship. But more on that later.

 We hope you enjoy this week=E2=80=99s edition of the Telegram!

Sincerely,

Member of Congress

                          Committee Update
Committee on Natural Resources=20
I participated in two hearings for the House Natural Resources Committee th=
is week. The first was a discussion about the future of America=E2=80=99s public l=
ands. One of the witnesses was Idaho=E2=80=99s Governor, Brad Little. It was his s=
tate that launched the Good Neighbor Authority, something that we now use he=
re in Wisconsin. He is a strong advocate for shared stewardship and access t=
o public lands for multiple use. I asked him if the environment in Idaho is =
in better shape than it was four years ago as a result of these policies, an=
d he replied =E2=80=9CYes, absolutely.=E2=80=9D The environmental achievements in Idaho =
can be directly attributed to these common-sense management practices, which=
 have led to cleaner air and water while protecting local control and expand=
ing opportunities for recreation and wise use. When management of public lan=
ds is proactive and public access is preserved, it is a win-win for both the=
 environment and local economies.

The other hearing I attended this week was a full committee discussion on U=
.S. territories and insular areas. I directed my questions to both the Gover=
nor of Puerto Rico as well as the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northe=
rn Mariana Islands (CNMI). I asked Governor Pedro Pierluisi of Puerto Rico a=
bout unpaid debts owed to companies who helped clean up the island in the af=
termath of Hurricane Maria. Multiple Wisconsin companies participated in rec=
overy efforts, but were never paid for their work =E2=80=93 in some cases to the t=
une of millions of dollars. I asked the governor about the problem and plan =
to follow up with him soon to resolve it. As for Governor Ralph Torres of th=
e CNMI, I asked him about the issue of Communist Chinese =E2=80=9Cbirth tourism=E2=80=9D=
 on the islands. Telegram readers may recall that I raised concerns about th=
is little-known but growing problem late last year, which involves Chinese n=
ationals exploiting a loophole in immigration law to enter the CNMI, a U.S. =
territory, without a visa and give birth to children who automatically recei=
ve U.S. citizenship. The problem has become so widespread that births to for=
eign nationals in Saipan now outnumber those to legal U.S. residents. This l=
oophole is national security issue, and I was pleased to hear the governor e=
xpress a willingness to work with me to close it.=20

                          Legislative Update
=E2=80=9CWoke=E2=80=9D Dems push radical, racial quota agenda=E2=80=A6
Over the last few months, we=E2=80=99ve seen a disappointing push in Washington t=
o treat Americans differently based solely on their race. Instead of treatin=
g people fairly, without regard to the color of their skin or their ethnic b=
ackground, there are increasing calls in some circles to abandon America=E2=80=99s=
 promise of equal protection under the law in favor of a dangerous quota sys=
tem. Just this week, a Senator from Illinois, Tammy Duckworth, threatened to=
 block executive branch nominees based on their race, declaring =E2=80=9CI will vo=
te for racial minorities and I will vote for LGBTQ, but anybody else, I=E2=80=99m =
not voting for.=E2=80=9D Sadly, it isn=E2=80=99t just a few lawmakers going down this ro=
ad. The $1.9 trillion, partisan spending package that recently became law se=
t aside $5 billion for farmer debt relief =E2=80=93 but only for non-white farmers=
. That=E2=80=99s disappointing. It=E2=80=99s one thing to target relief programs to farm=
ers who have fallen on hard times and are struggling to make ends meet, but =
it=E2=80=99s wrong for the government to pick winners and losers based on race. I =
am committed to ensuring that all Americans are respected as individuals, an=
d I will continue to oppose these unfair practices.

=E2=80=A6But It=E2=80=99s not just Washington going =E2=80=9Cwoke=E2=80=9D=20
The corrosive =E2=80=9Cwoke=E2=80=9D dogma that seems to tighten its grip on the nation=
=E2=80=99s capital with each passing day has also spread to corporate boardrooms a=
nd college campuses.  Some of you may have seen the news earlier this month =
about a New York City university holding a half-dozen segregated graduation =
ceremonies. You may also have seen whistleblower reports about a well-known =
soda company urging its employees to be =E2=80=9Cless white=E2=80=9D as part of a divers=
ity training session. This week one of the nation=E2=80=99s largest health insuran=
ce companies also reportedly got into the act, with employees being subjecte=
d to indoctrination on concepts like =E2=80=9Cwhite privilege,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cgender privil=
ege=E2=80=9D and even =E2=80=9Creligious privilege.=E2=80=9D One worker alleged that the compa=
ny is going even further =E2=80=93 making hiring and promotion decisions based sol=
ely on race. Nobody should be told that they are inferior or evil, be denied=
 a job, passed over for a promotion, or refused admission to a university be=
cause of their race or sex. In America, the rights of the individual come fi=
rst =E2=80=93 and radical identity politics have no place.

Big Tech censorship is wrong. Just ask=E2=80=A6Bernie Sanders?=20
You read that right. While I rarely agree with Senator Bernie Sanders, the =
Vermont lawmaker made a good point about the danger of online censorship thi=
s week.  =E2=80=9CYesterday it was Donald Trump who was banned and tomorrow it cou=
ld be somebody else who has a very different point of view,=E2=80=9D Senator Sande=
rs said during an interview. =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t like giving that much power to a h=
andful of high-tech people.=E2=80=9D You can read more about that here.=20

Long-term Care Facility letters
Last week I joined my colleague Rep. Mike Gallagher (WI-08) in asking Gover=
nor Evers provide information about the data shortfalls occurring at the Dep=
artment of Health Services. The letter was drafted by members of our Wiscons=
in delegation following a report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about dea=
ths in long-term care facilities. Prior to last week DHS reported fewer than=
 30 percent of COVID-19 deaths in Wisconsin occurring in long-term care faci=
lity settings (i.e. nursing homes or assisted living). But a =E2=80=9Cdata cleanup=
=E2=80=9D DHS conducted last week revealed a much higher figure =E2=80=93 more than 45 p=
ercent. Additionally, I signed on to a letter led by Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (=
WI-05) requesting that DHS expedite the publishing of the data on the remain=
ing deaths which have not received a classification on the website. This is =
not only an issue of transparency with our government agencies, but also a m=
atter of justice for our seniors who were put into vulnerable situations dur=
ing the pandemic.=20
                            District Update
COVID/Vaccine=20
This week Wisconsin reached some 2.5 million shots in arms, with more than =
850,000 second doses completed. The distribution has been as follows: 1.1 mi=
llion Moderna vaccines, 1.3 million Pfizer vaccines, and 50,000 Johnson & Jo=
hnson vaccines. For those of you looking to check your eligibility status pl=
ease visit this page on the DHS website, which lists qualifying populations =
along with the full list medical conditions qualifying for eligibility. Addi=
tionally, the state now has their online registration system available to al=
l residents. If you are not registered with your local physician or public h=
ealth office, please utilize the state registration system so you can receiv=
e a location and appointment time as soon as possible. The website is https:=
//vaccinate.wi.gov/en-US/. The current eligible population includes all 1C r=
esidents=E2=80=94 health care personnel, police and fire personnel, educators, ind=
ividuals enrolled in Medicaid, congregate living facility staff and resident=
s, and individuals with qualifying medical conditions.

What=E2=80=99s in the stimulus for schools?=20
While many of you may have seen reports about the laundry-list of things fu=
nded by Speaker Pelosi=E2=80=99s $1.9 trillion spending bill that President Biden =
recently signed into law, I wanted to highlight the $129 billion included fo=
r K-12 schools. The breakdown is as follows: $110 billion allocated directly=
 to school districts to spend as they see fit, $7 billion to the federal =E2=80=9C=
E-Rate=E2=80=9D program to help students get online, $1.2 billion for summer progr=
amming, $2.6 billion to students with disabilities, and another $2.6 billion=
 to private schools with a significant low-income population. It=E2=80=99s importa=
nt to remember that many of our schools in Northern Wisconsin remained open =
throughout the pandemic =E2=80=93 showing they were able to successfully implement=
 all of these measures without billions of additional dollars in federal spe=
nding.

Soo Locks Update=20
This week I had the pleasure of meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Enginee=
rs Detroit District leadership to discuss updates on the Soo Locks project, =
as well as updates on other regional issues. For those who don=E2=80=99t know what=
 the Soo Locks are, they are a set of locks in the Upper Peninsula of Michig=
an that allow ships to travel from Lake Superior to the other Great Lakes. T=
hese locks are vital to not only our region=E2=80=99s shipping and trade, but the =
entire country because almost all high-strength steel gets shipped through t=
he Poe Lock, much of which comes out of the port of Duluth-Superior. These l=
ocks are an essential piece of our infrastructure and are vital to our manuf=
acturing production throughout the U.S., but another lock is desperately nee=
ded. The Army Corps of Engineers have been working on adding a third lock th=
at will increase capacity for more lake freight ships, and the set date for =
completion is 2030. This project alone will create around 1,240 jobs annuall=
y and have a long-lasting economic impact once the lock is completed, increa=
sing the number of ships able to pass through to the other Great Lakes. I wi=
ll continue to monitor this project and ensure that the Soo Locks keep shipm=
ents in the Great Lakes moving forward.

tal to our manufacturing production throughout the U.S., but another lock is=
 desperately needed. The Army Corps of Engineers have been working on adding=
 a third lock that will increase capacity for more lake freight ships, and t=
he set date for completion is 2030. This project alone will create around 1,=
240 jobs annually and have a long-lasting economic impact once the lock is c=
ompleted, increasing the number of ships able to pass through to the other G=
reat Lakes. I will continue to monitor this project and ensure that the Soo =
Locks keep shipments in the Great Lakes moving forward.<br><br><hr><p style=3D=
