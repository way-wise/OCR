Dear Friend, The federal government sure can learn a lot from the average A=
merican family. Families across the country know what it=E2=80=99s like to create =
a budget, accounting for everything from housing and utilities, to groceries=
, insurance, and transportation. They live within their means, knowing that =
every month, there will be new bills to pay. =20

The federalgovernmentfailsto budget long-term, and spendsoutside itsmeans. =
Why? Because too many politicians over-spend your tax dollars to curry favor=
 with special interest groups. The taxes that politicians set aside for spec=
ial interest groups is called =E2=80=9Cpork,=E2=80=9D and there is far too much of it. I=
t could come in the form of unnecessary government contracts for mercenaries=
 or corporations. As a result, we have had a deficit for the past 17 years a=
nd have amassed $21 trillion in total debt. Next year, the deficit is expect=
ed to hit nearly $1 trillion. On overspending, it doesn=E2=80=99t seem to matter w=
hether Republicans or Democrats are in charge,  it just gets worse and worse=
. We have to stop this spending spree because it only leaves us economically=
 beholden to foreign countries we borrow from like China and Saudi Arabia. T=
he U.S. is one of the wealthiest nations on the planet, collecting a whoppin=
g $3.3 trillion in taxes; that should be enough to balance the budget! Since=
 starting in Congress, I have championed over 100 spending cuts, eliminating=
 =E2=80=9Cpork=E2=80=9D by ending sweetheart deals for special interest groups. I have a=
lso sponsored a balanced budget amendment to force Congressto live within ou=
r means. As your Representative, I am doing everything I can to stop the was=
tefulness, including voting against most of the bloated spending bills.The w=
ay we are headed simply doesn=E2=80=99t add up.=20
